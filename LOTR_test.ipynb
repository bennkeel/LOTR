      "unchanged even in certain fundamental ideas concerning \n",
      "the nature of the world it portrays; while the same legends \n",

      "variants, both in detail and in larger perspectives, became \n",
      "so complex, so pervasive, and so many-layered that a final \n",
      "and definitive version seemed unattainable. Moreover the \n",
      "old legends ('old' now not only in their derivation from the \n",
      "remote First Age, but also in terms of my father's life) \n",

      "work out a single text selecting and arranging in such a way \n",
      "as seemed to me to produce the most coherent and \n",
      "internally self-consistent narrative. In this work the \n",
      "concluding chapters (from the death of Turin Turambar) \n",
      "introduced peculiar difficulties, in that they had remained \n",

      "but few together, while the rest hearkened; for each \n",
      "comprehended only that part of me mind of lluvatar from \n",
      "which he came, and in the understanding of their brethren \n",

      "\n",
      "And it came to pass that lluvatar called together all the \n",

      "them things greater and more wonderful than he had yet \n",
      "revealed; and the glory of its beginning and the splendour \n",
      "of its end amazed the Ainur, so that they bowed before \n",
      "lluvatar and were silent. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then lluvatar said to them: 'Of the theme that I have \n",
      "declared to you, I will now that ye make in harmony together \n",
      "a Great Music. And since I have kindled you with the Flame \n",
      "Imperishable, ye shall show forth your powers in adorning \n",

      "will. But I win sit and hearken, and be glad that through you \n",
      "great beauty has been wakened into song.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the voices of the Ainur, like unto harps and lutes, \n",
      "and pipes and trumpets, and viols and organs, and like \n",
      "unto countless choirs singing with words, began to fashion \n",
      "the theme of lluvatar to a great music; and a sound arose of \n",
      "endless interchanging melodies woven in harmony that \n",
      "passed beyond hearing into the depths and into the \n",
      "heights, and the places of the dwelling of lluvatar were filled \n",
      "to overflowing, and the music and the echo of the music \n",
      "went out into the Void, and it was not void. Never since \n",
      "have the Ainur made any music like to this music, though it \n",
      "has been said that a greater still shall be made before \n",

      "\n",
      "lluvatar by the choirs of the Ainur and the Children of lluvatar \n",
      "after the end of days. Then the themes of lluvatar shall be \n",
      "played aright, and take Being in the moment of their \n",
      "utterance, for all shall then understand fully his intent in their \n",
      "part, and each shall know the comprehension of each, and \n",
      "lluvatar shall give to their thoughts the secret fire, being well \n",
      "pleased. \n",

      "But now lluvatar sat and hearkened, and for a great \n",
      "while it seemed good to him, for in the music there were no \n",
      "flaws. But as the theme progressed, it came into the heart \n",
      "of Melkor to interweave matters of his own imagining that \n",
      "were not in accord with the theme of lluvatar, for he sought \n",
      "therein to increase the power and glory of the part assigned \n",
      "to himself. To Melkor among the Ainur had been given the \n",
      "greatest gifts of power and knowledge, and he had a share \n",
      "in all the gifts of his brethren. He had gone often alone into \n",
      "the void places seeking the Imperishable Flame; for desire \n",
      "grew hot within him to bring into Being things of his own, \n",
      "and it seemed to him that lluvatar took no thought for the \n",
      "Void, and he was impatient of its emptiness. Yet he found \n",
      "not the Fire, for it is with lluvatar. But being alone he had \n",
      "begun to conceive thoughts of his own unlike those of his \n",
      "brethren. \n",
      "\n",
      "Some of these thoughts he now wove into his music, \n",
      "and straightway discord arose about him, and many that \n",
      "sang nigh him grew despondent, and their thought was \n",
      "disturbed and their music faltered; but some began to \n",
      "attune their music to his rather than to the thought which \n",
      "they had at first. Then the discord of Melkor spread ever \n",
      "wider, and the melodies which had been heard before \n",
      "foundered in a sea of turbulent sound. But lluvatar sat and \n",
      "hearkened until it seemed that about his throne there was a \n",
      "raging storm, as of dark waters that made war one upon \n",
      "another in an endless wrath that would not be assuaged. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then lluvatar arose, and the Ainur perceived that he \n",
      "smiled; and he lifted up his left hand, and a new theme \n",
      "began amid the storm, like and yet unlike to the former \n",
      "theme, and it gathered power and had new beauty. But the \n",
      "discord of Melkor rose in uproar and contended with it, and \n",
      "again there was a war of sound more violent than before, \n",
      "until many of the Ainur were dismayed and sang no longer, \n",
      "and Melkor had the mastery. Then again lluvatar arose, and \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the Ainur perceived that his countenance was stem; and he \n",
      "lifted up his right hand, and behold! a third theme grew \n",
      "amid the confusion, and it was unlike the others. For it \n",
      "seemed at first soft and sweet, a mere rippling of gentle \n",
      "sounds in delicate melodies; but it could not be quenched, \n",
      "and it took to itself power and profundity. And it seemed at \n",
      "last that there were two musics progressing at one time \n",
      "before the seat of lluvatar, and they were utterly at variance. \n",
      "The one was deep and wide and beautiful, but slow and \n",
      "blended with an immeasurable sorrow, from which its \n",
      "beauty chiefly came. The other had now achieved a unity of \n",
      "its own; but it was loud, and vain, and endlessly repeated; \n",
      "and it had little harmony, but rather a clamorous unison as \n",
      "of many trumpets braying upon a few notes. And it essayed \n",
      "to drown the other music by the violence of its voice, but it \n",
      "seemed that its most triumphant notes were taken by the \n",
      "other and woven into its own solemn pattern. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the midst of this strife, whereat the halls of lluvatar \n",
      "shook and a tremor ran out into the silences yet unmoved, \n",
      "lluvatar arose a third time, and his face was terrible to \n",
      "behold. Then he raised up both his hands, and in one \n",
      "chord, deeper than the Abyss, higher than the Firmament, \n",
      "piercing as the light of the eye of lluvatar, the Music ceased. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then lluvatar spoke, and he said: 'Mighty are the Ainur, \n",
      "and mightiest among them is Melkor; but that he may know, \n",
      "and all the Ainur, that I am lluvatar, those things that ye have \n",
      "sung, I will show them forth, that ye may see what ye have \n",
      "done. And thou, Melkor, shalt see that no theme may be \n",
      "played that hath not its uttermost source in me, nor can any \n",
      "alter the music in my despite. For he that attempteth this \n",
      "shall prove but mine instrument in the devising of things \n",
      "more wonderful, which he himself hath not imagined.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Ainur were afraid, and they did not yet \n",
      "comprehend the words that were said to them; and Melkor \n",
      "was filled with shame, of which came secret anger. But \n",
      "lluvatar arose in splendour, and he went forth from the fair \n",
      "regions that he had made for the Ainur; and the Ainur \n",
      "followed him. \n",
      "\n",
      "But when they were come into the Void, lluvatar said to \n",
      "them: 'Behold your Music!' And he showed to them a vision, \n",
      "giving to them sight where before was only hearing; arid \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "they saw a new World made visible before them, and it was \n",
      "globed amid the Void, and it was sustained therein, but \n",
      "was not of it. And as they looked and wondered this World \n",
      "began to unfold its history, and it seemed to them that it \n",
      "lived and grew. And when the Ainur had gazed for a while \n",
      "and were silent, lluvatar said again: 'Behold your Music! \n",
      "This is your minstrelsy; and each of you shall find contained \n",
      "herein, amid the design that I set before you, all those \n",
      "things which it may seem that he himself devised or added. \n",
      "And thou, Melkor, wilt discover all the secret thoughts of thy \n",
      "mind, and wilt perceive that they are but a part of the whole \n",
      "and tributary to its glory.' \n",
      "\n",
      "And many other things lluvatar spoke to the Ainur at \n",
      "that time, and because of their memory of his words, and \n",
      "the knowledge that each has of the music that he himself \n",
      "made, the Ainur know much of what was, and is, and is to \n",
      "come, and few things are unseen by them. Yet some things \n",
      "there are that they cannot see, neither alone nor taking \n",
      "counsel together; for to none but himself has lluvatar \n",
      "revealed all that he has in store, and in every age there \n",
      "come forth things that are new and have no foretelling, for \n",
      "they do not proceed from the past. And so it was that as \n",
      "this vision of the World was played before them, the Ainur \n",
      "saw that it contained things which they had not thought. And \n",
      "they saw with amazement the coming of the Children of \n",
      "lluvatar, and the habitation that was prepared for them; and \n",
      "they perceived that they themselves in the labour of their \n",
      "music had been busy with the preparation of this dwelling, \n",
      "and yet knew not that it had any purpose beyond its own \n",
      "beauty. For the Children of lluvatar were conceived by him \n",
      "alone; and they came with the third theme, and were not in \n",
      "the theme which lluvatar propounded at the beginning, and \n",
      "none of the Ainur had part in their making. Therefore when \n",
      "they beheld them, the more did they love them, being things \n",
      "other than themselves, strange and free, wherein they saw \n",
      "the mind of lluvatar reflected anew, and learned yet a little \n",
      "more of his wisdom, which otherwise had been hidden \n",
      "even from the Ainur. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now the Children of lluvatar are Elves and Men, the \n",
      "Firstborn and the Followers. And amid all the splendours of \n",
      "the World, its vast halls and spaces, and its wheeling fires, \n",
      "lluvatar chose a place for their habitation in the Deeps of \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Time and in the midst of the innumerable stars. And this \n",
      "habitation might seem a little thing to those who consider \n",
      "only the majesty of the Ainur, and not their terrible \n",
      "sharpness; as who should take the whole field of Arda for \n",
      "the foundation of a pillar and so raise it until the cone of its \n",
      "summit were more bitter than a needle; or who consider \n",
      "only the immeasurable vastness of the World, which still the \n",
      "Ainur are shaping, and not the minute precision to which \n",
      "they shape all things therein. But when the Ainur had beheld \n",
      "this habitation in a vision and had seen the Children of \n",
      "lluvatar arise therein, then many of the most mighty among \n",
      "them bent all their thought and their desire towards that \n",
      "place. And of these Melkor was the chief, even as he was \n",
      "in the beginning the greatest of the Ainur who took part in \n",
      "the Music. And he feigned, even to himself at first, that he \n",
      "desired to go thither and order all things for the good of the \n",
      "Children of lluvatar, controlling the turmoils of the heat and \n",
      "the cold that had come to pass through him. But he desired \n",
      "rather to subdue to his will both Elves and Men, envying the \n",
      "gifts with which lluvatar promised to endow them; and he \n",
      "wished himself to have subject and servants, and to be \n",
      "called Lord, and to be a master over other wills. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But the other Ainur looked upon this habitation set \n",
      "within the vast spaces of the World, which the Elves call \n",
      "Arda, the Earth; and their hearts rejoiced in light, and their \n",
      "eyes beholding many colours were filled with gladness; but \n",
      "because of the roaring of the sea they felt a great unquiet. \n",
      "And they observed the winds and the air, and the matters of \n",
      "which Arda was made, of iron and stone and silver and \n",
      "gold and many substances: but of all these water they most \n",
      "greatly praised. And it is said by the Eldar that in water \n",
      "there lives yet the echo of the Music of the Ainur more than \n",
      "in any substance else that is in this Earth; and many of the \n",
      "Children of lluvatar hearken still unsated to the voices of the \n",
      "Sea, and yet know not for what they listen. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now to water had that Ainu whom the Elves can Ulmo \n",
      "turned his thought, and of all most deeply was he instructed \n",
      "by lluvatar in music. But of the airs and winds Manwe most \n",
      "had pondered, who is the noblest of the Ainur. Of the fabric \n",
      "of Earth had Aule thought, to whom lluvatar had given skin \n",
      "and knowledge scarce less than to Melkor; but the delight \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "and pride of Aule is in the deed of making, and in the thing \n",
      "made, and neither in possession nor in his own mastery; \n",
      "wherefore he gives and hoards not, and is free from care, \n",
      "passing ever on to some new work. \n",
      "\n",
      "And lluvatar spoke to Ulmo, and said: 'Seest thou not \n",
      "how here in this little realm in the Deeps of Time Melkor \n",
      "hath made war upon thy province? He hath bethought him \n",
      "of bitter cold immoderate, and yet hath not destroyed the \n",
      "beauty of thy fountains, nor of my clear pools. Behold the \n",
      "snow, and the cunning work of frost! Melkor hath devised \n",
      "heats and fire without restraint, and hath not dried up thy \n",
      "desire nor utterly quelled the music of the sea. Behold \n",
      "rather the height and glory of the clouds, and the \n",
      "everchanging mists; and listen to the fall of rain upon the \n",
      "Earth! And in these clouds thou art drawn nearer to Manwe, \n",
      "thy friend, whom thou lovest.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Ulmo answered: Truly, Water is become now \n",
      "fairer than my heart imagined, neither had my secret \n",
      "thought conceived the snowflake, nor in all my music was \n",
      "contained the falling of the rain. I will seek Manwe, that he \n",
      "and I may make melodies for ever to my delight!' And \n",
      "Manwe and Ulmo have from the beginning been allied, and \n",
      "in all things have served most faithfully the purpose of \n",
      "lluvatar. \n",
      "\n",
      "But even as Ulmo spoke, and while the Ainur were yet \n",
      "gazing upon this vision, it was taken away and hidden from \n",
      "their sight; and it seemed to them that in that moment they \n",
      "perceived a new thing, Darkness, which they had not known \n",
      "before except in thought. But they had become enamoured \n",
      "of the beauty of the vision and engrossed in the unfolding of \n",
      "the World which came there to being, and their minds were \n",
      "filled with it; for the history was incomplete and the circles of \n",
      "time not full-wrought when the vision was taken away. And \n",
      "some have said that the vision ceased ere the fulfilment of \n",
      "the Dominion of Men and the fading of the Firstborn; \n",
      "wherefore, though the Music is over all, the Valar have not \n",
      "seen as with sight the Later Ages or the ending of the \n",
      "World. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then there was unrest among the Ainur; but lluvatar \n",
      "called to them, and said: 'I know the desire of your minds \n",
      "that what ye have seen should verily be, not only in your \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "thought, but even as ye yourselves are, and yet other. \n",
      "Therefore I say: Ea! Let these things Be! And I will send \n",
      "forth into the Void the Flame Imperishable, and it shall be at \n",
      "the heart of the World, and the World shall Be; and those of \n",
      "you that will may go down into it. And suddenly the Ainur \n",
      "saw afar off a light, as it were a cloud with a living heart of \n",
      "flame; and they knew that this was no vision only, but that \n",
      "lluvatar had made a new thing: Ea, the World that Is. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus it came to pass that of the Ainur some abode still \n",
      "with lluvatar beyond the confines of the World; but others, \n",
      "and among them many of the greatest and most fair, took \n",
      "the leave of lluvatar and descended into it. But this \n",
      "condition lluvatar made, or it is the necessity of their love, \n",
      "that their power should thenceforward be contained and \n",
      "bounded in the World, to be within it for ever, until it is \n",
      "complete, so that they are its life and it is theirs. And \n",
      "therefore they are named the Valar, the Powers of the \n",
      "World. \n",
      "\n",
      "But when the Valar entered into Ea they were at first \n",
      "astounded and at a loss, for it was as if naught was yet \n",
      "made which they had seen in vision, and all was but on \n",
      "point to begin and yet unshaped, and it was dark. For the \n",
      "Great Music had been but the growth and flowering of \n",
      "thought in the Tuneless Halls, and the Vision only a \n",
      "foreshowing; but now they had entered in at the beginning \n",
      "of Time, and the Valar perceived that the World had been \n",
      "but foreshadowed and foresung, and they must achieve it. \n",
      "So began their great labours in wastes unmeasured and \n",
      "unexplored, and in ages uncounted and forgotten, until in \n",
      "the Deeps of Time and in the midst of the vast halls of Ea \n",
      "there came to be that hour and that place where was made \n",
      "the habitation of the Children of lluvatar. And in this work the \n",
      "chief part was taken by Manwe and Aule and Ulmo; but \n",
      "Melkor too was there from the first, and he meddled in all \n",
      "that was done, turning it if he might to his own desires and \n",
      "purposes; and he kindled great fires. When therefore Earth \n",
      "was yet young and full of flame Melkor coveted it, and he \n",
      "said to the other Valar: This shall be my own kingdom; and \n",
      "I name it unto myself!' \n",
      "\n",
      "But Manwe was the brother of Melkor in the mind of \n",
      "lluvatar, and he was the chief instrument of the second \n",
      "theme that lluvatar had raised up against the discord of \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Melkor; and he called unto himself many spirits both greater \n",
      "and less, and they came down into the fields of Arda and \n",
      "aided Manwe, lest Melkor should hinder the fulfilment of \n",
      "their labour for ever, and Earth should wither ere it flowered. \n",
      "And Manwe said unto Melkor: This kingdom thou shalt not \n",
      "take for thine own, wrongfully, for many others have \n",
      "laboured here do less than thou.' And there was strife \n",
      "between Melkor and the other Valar; and for that time \n",
      "Melkor withdrew and departed to other regions and did \n",
      "there what he would; but he did not put the desire of the \n",
      "Kingdom of Arda from his heart. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now the Valar took to themselves shape and hue; and \n",
      "because they were drawn into the World by love of the \n",
      "Children of lluvatar, for whom they hoped, they took shape \n",
      "after that manner which they had beheld in the Vision of \n",
      "lluvatar, save only in majesty and splendour. Moreover their \n",
      "shape comes of their knowledge of the visible World, rather \n",
      "than of the World itself; and they need it not, save only as \n",
      "we use raiment, and yet we may be naked and suffer no \n",
      "loss of our being. Therefore the Valar may walk, if they will, \n",
      "unclad, and then even the Eldar cannot clearly perceive \n",
      "them, though they be present. But when they desire to \n",
      "clothe themselves the Valar take upon them forms some as \n",
      "of male and some as of female; for that difference of \n",
      "temper they had even from their beginning, and it is but \n",
      "bodied forth in the choice of each, not made by the choice, \n",
      "even as with us male and female may be shown by the \n",
      "raiment but is not made thereby. But the shapes wherein \n",
      "the Great Ones array themselves are not at all times like to \n",
      "the shapes of the kings and queens of the Children of \n",
      "lluvatar; for at times they may clothe themselves in their own \n",
      "thought, made visible in forms of majesty and dread. \n",
      "\n",
      "And the Valar drew unto them many companions, \n",
      "some less, some well nigh as great as themselves, and \n",
      "they laboured together in the ordering of the Earth and the \n",
      "curbing of its tumults. Then Melkor saw what was done, and \n",
      "that the Valar walked on Earth as powers visible, clad in the \n",
      "raiment of the World, and were lovely and glorious to see, \n",
      "and blissful, and that the Earth was becoming as a garden \n",
      "for their delight, for its turmoils were subdued. His envy \n",
      "grew then the greater within him; and he also took visible \n",
      "form, but because of his mood and the malice that burned \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "in him that form was dark and terrible. And he descended \n",
      "upon Arda in power and majesty greater than any other of \n",
      "the Valar, as a mountain that wades in the sea and has its \n",
      "head above the clouds and is clad in ice and crowned with \n",
      "smoke and fire; and the light of the eyes of Melkor was like \n",
      "a flame that withers with heat and pierces with a deadly \n",
      "cold. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus began the first battle of the Valar with Melkor for \n",
      "the dominion of Arda; and of those tumults the Elves know \n",
      "but little. For what has here been declared is come from the \n",
      "Valar themselves, with whom the Eldalie spoke in the land \n",
      "of Valinor, and by whom they were instructed; but little \n",
      "would the Valar ever tell of the wars before the coming of \n",
      "the Elves. Yet it is told among the Eldar that the Valar \n",
      "endeavoured ever, in despite of Melkor, to rule the Earth \n",
      "and to prepare it for the coming of the Firstborn; and they \n",
      "built lands and Melkor destroyed them; valleys they delved \n",
      "and Melkor raised them up; mountains they carved and \n",
      "Melkor threw them down; seas they hollowed and Melkor \n",
      "spilled them; and naught might have peace or come to \n",
      "lasting growth, for as surely as the Valar began a labour so \n",
      "would Melkor undo it or corrupt it. And yet their labour was \n",
      "not all in vain; and though nowhere and in no work was their \n",
      "will and purpose wholly fulfilled, and all things were in hue \n",
      "and shape other than the Valar had at first intended, slowly \n",
      "nonetheless the Earth was fashioned and made firm. And \n",
      "thus was the habitation of the Children of lluvatar \n",

      "in powers; and there was long strife between them, in which \n",
      "Melkor ever marred or undid the works of Aule, and Aule \n",
      "grew weary in repairing the tumults and disorders of \n",
      "Melkor. Both, also, desired to make things of their own that \n",
      "should be new and unthought of by others, and delighted in \n",

      "and submitted all that he did to his will; and he did not envy \n",

      "hearing in the far heaven that there was battle in the Little \n",

      "like a mighty wind, scattering cloud and darkness before it; \n",

      "In that time the Valar brought order to the seas and the \n",

      "seeds that she had long devised. And since, when the fires \n",
      "were subdued or buried beneath the primeval hills, there \n",
      "was need of light, Aule at the prayer of Yavanna wrought \n",
      "two mighty lamps for the lighting of the Middle-earth which \n",
      "he had built amid the encircling seas. Then Varda filled the \n",
      "lamps and Manwe hallowed them, and the Valar set them \n",
      "upon high pillars, more lofty far than are any mountains of \n",
      "the later days. One lamp they raised near to the north of \n",
      "Middle-earth, and it was named llluin; and the other was \n",
      "raised in the south, and it was named Ormal; and the light \n",
      "of the Lamps of the Valar flowed out over the Earth, so that \n",
      "all was lit as it were in a changeless day. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the seeds that Yavanna had sown began swiftly \n",
      "to sprout and to burgeon, and there arose a multitude of \n",
      "growing things great and small, mosses and grasses and \n",
      "great ferns, and trees whose tops were crowned with cloud \n",
      "as they were living mountains, but whose feet were \n",
      "wrapped in a green twilight. And beasts came forth and \n",
      "dwelt in the grassy plains, or in the rivers and the lakes, or \n",
      "walked in the shadows of the woods. As yet no flower had \n",
      "bloomed nor any bird had sung, for these things waited still \n",
      "their time in the bosom of Yavanna; but wealth there was of \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "her imagining, and nowhere more rich than in the midmost \n",
      "parts of the Earth, where the light of both the Lamps met \n",
      "and blended. And there upon the Isle of Almaren in the \n",
      "Great Lake was the first dwelling of the Valar when all \n",
      "things were young, and new-made green was yet a marvel \n",
      "in the eyes of the makers; and they were long content. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now it came to pass that while the Valar rested from \n",
      "their labours, and watched the growth and unfolding of the \n",
      "things that they had devised and begun, Manwe ordained a \n",
      "great feast; and the Valar and an their host came at his \n",
      "bidding. But Aule and Tulkas were weary; for the craft of \n",
      "Aule and the strength of Tulkas had been at the service of \n",
      "an without ceasing fax the days of their labour. And Melkor \n",
      "knew of an that was done, for even then he had secret \n",
      "friends and spies among the Maiar whom he had converted \n",
      "to his cause; and far off in the darkness he was filled with \n",
      "hatred, being jealous of the work of his peers, whom he \n",
      "desired to make subject to himself. Therefore he gathered \n",
      "to himself spirits out of the halls of Ea that he had perverted \n",
      "to his service, and he deemed himself strong. And seeing \n",
      "now his time he drew near again to Arda, and looked down \n",
      "upon it, and the beauty of the Earth in its Spring filled him \n",
      "the more with hate. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now therefore the Valar were gathered upon Almaren, \n",
      "fearing no evil, and because of the light of llluin they did not \n",
      "perceive the shadow in the north that was cast from afar by \n",
      "Melkor; for he was grown dark as the Night of the Void. And \n",
      "it is sung that in that feast of the Spring of Arda Tulkas \n",
      "espoused Nessa the sister of Orome, and she danced \n",
      "before the Valar upon the green grass of Almaren. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Tulkas slept, being weary and content, and \n",
      "Melkor deemed that his hour had come. And he passed \n",
      "therefore over the Walls of the Night with his host, and \n",
      "came to Middle-earth far in the north; and the Valar were \n",
      "not aware of him. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now Melkor began the delving and building of a vast \n",
      "fortress, deep under Earth, beneath dark mountains where \n",
      "the beams of llluin were cold and dim. That stronghold was \n",
      "named Utumno. And though the Valar knew naught of it as \n",
      "yet, nonetheless the evil of Melkor and the blight of his \n",
      "hatred flowed out thence, and the Spring of Arda was \n",
      "marred. Green things fell sick and rotted, and rivers were \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "choked with weeds and slime, and fens were made, rank \n",
      "and poisonous, the breeding place of flies; and forests \n",
      "grew dark and perilous, the haunts of fear; and beasts \n",
      "became monsters of horn and ivory and dyed the earth with \n",
      "blood. Then the Valar knew indeed that Melkor was at work \n",
      "again, and they sought for his hiding place. But Melkor, \n",
      "trusting in the strength of Utumno and the might of his \n",
      "servants, came forth suddenly to war, and struck the first \n",
      "blow, ere the Valar were prepared; and he assailed the \n",
      "lights of llluin and Ormal, and cast down their pillars and \n",
      "broke their lamps. In the overthrow of the mighty pillars \n",
      "lands were broken and seas arose in tumult; and when the \n",
      "lamps were spilled destroying flame was poured out over \n",
      "the Earth. And the shape of Arda and the symmetry of its \n",
      "waters and its lands was marred in that time, so that the \n",
      "first designs of the Valar were never after restored. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the confusion and the darkness Melkor escaped, \n",
      "though fear fell upon him; for above the roaring of the seas \n",
      "he heard the voice of Manwe as a mighty wind, and the \n",
      "earth trembled beneath the feet of Tulkas. But he came to \n",
      "Utumno ere Tulkas could overtake him; and there he lay \n",
      "hid. And the Valar could not at that time overcome him, for \n",
      "the greater part of their strength was needed to restrain the \n",
      "tumults of the Earth, and to save from ruin all that could be \n",
      "saved of their labour; and afterwards they feared to rend \n",
      "the Earth again, until they knew where the Children of \n",
      "lluvatar were dwelling, who were yet to come in a time that \n",
      "was hidden from the Valar. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus ended the Spring of Arda. The dwelling of the \n",
      "Valar upon Almaren was utterly destroyed, and they had no \n",
      "abiding place upon the face of the Earth. Therefore they \n",
      "departed from Middle-earth and went to the Land of Aman, \n",
      "the westernmost of all lands upon the borders of the world; \n",
      "for its west shores looked upon the Outer Sea, that is called \n",
      "by the Elves Ekkaia, encircling the Kingdom of Arda. How \n",
      "wide is that sea none know but the Valar; and beyond it are \n",
      "the Walls of the Night. But the east shores of Aman were \n",
      "the uttermost end of Belegaer, the Great Sea at the West; \n",
      "and since Melkor was returned to Middle-earth and they \n",
      "could not yet overcome him, the Valar fortified their \n",
      "dwelling, and upon the shores of the sea they raised the \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Pelori, the Mountains of Aman, highest upon Earth. And \n",
      "above all the mountains of the Pelori was that height upon \n",
      "whose summit Manwe set his throne. Taniquetil the Elves \n",
      "name that holy mountain, and Oiolosse Everlasting \n",
      "Whiteness, and Elerrina Crowned with Stars, and many \n",
      "names beside; but the Sindar spoke of it in their later \n",
      "tongue as Amon Uilos. From their halls upon Taniquetil \n",
      "Manwe and Varda could look out across the Earth even \n",
      "into the furthest East. \n",
      "\n",
      "Behind the walls of the Pelori the Valar established \n",
      "their domain in that region which is called Valinor, and \n",
      "there were their houses, their gardens, and their towers. In \n",
      "that guarded land the Valar gathered great store of light \n",
      "and an the fairest things that were saved from the ruin; and \n",
      "many others yet fairer they made anew, and Valinor \n",
      "became more beautiful even than Middle-earth in the \n",
      "Spring ofArda; and it was blessed, for the Deathless dwelt \n",
      "there, and there naught faded nor withered, neither was \n",
      "there any stain upon flower or leaf in that land, nor any \n",

      "And when Valinor was full-wrought and the mansions \n",
      "of the Valar were established, in the midst of the plain \n",
      "beyond the mountains they built their city, Valmar of many \n",
      "bells. Before its western gate there was a green mound, \n",
      "Ezellohar, that is named also Corollaire; and Yavanna \n",
      "hallowed it, and she sat there long upon the green grass \n",
      "and sang a song of power, in which was set all her thought \n",
      "of things that grow in the earth. But Nienna thought in \n",
      "silence, and watered the mould with tears. In that time the \n",
      "Valar were gathered together to hear the song of Yavanna, \n",
      "and they sat silent upon their thrones of council in the \n",

      "dew of silver light was ever falling, and the earth beneath \n",
      "was dappled with the shadow of his fluttering leaves. The \n",
      "other bore leaves of a young green like the new-opened \n",
      "beech; their edges were of glittering gold. Flowers swung \n",
      "upon her branches in clusters of yellow flame, formed each \n",
      "to a glowing horn that spilled a golden rain upon the ground; \n",
      "and from the blossom of that tree there came forth warmth \n",
      "and a great light. Telperion the one was called in Valinor, \n",
      "and Silpion, and Ninquelote, and many other names; but \n",
      "Laurelin the other was, and Malinalda, and Culurien, and \n",
      "many names in song beside. \n",
      "\n",
      "In seven hours the glory of each tree waxed to full and \n",
      "waned again to naught; and each awoke once more to life \n",
      "an hour before the other ceased to shine. Thus in Valinor \n",
      "twice every day there came a gentle hour of softer light \n",
      "when both trees were faint and their gold and silver beams \n",
      "were mingled. Telperion was the elder of the trees and \n",
      "came first to full stature and to bloom; and that first hour in \n",
      "which he shone, the white glimmer of a silver dawn, the \n",
      "Valar reckoned not into the tale of hours, but named it the \n",
      "Opening Hour, and counted from it the ages of their reign in \n",
      "Valinor. Therefore at the sixth hour of the First Day, and of \n",
      "all the joyful days thereafter, until the Darkening of Valinor, \n",
      "Telperion ceased his time of flower; and at the twelfth hour \n",
      "Laurelin her blossoming. And each day of the Valar in \n",
      "Aman contained twelve hours, and ended with the second \n",
      "mingling of the lights, in which Laurelin was waning but \n",
      "Telperion was waxing. But the light that was spilled from the \n",
      "trees endured long, ere it was taken up into the airs or sank \n",
      "down into the earth; and the dews of Telperion and the rain \n",
      "that fell from Laurelin Varda hoarded in great vats like \n",
      "shining lakes, that were to all the land of the Valar as wells \n",
      "of water and of light. Thus began the Days of the Bliss of \n",
      "Valinor; and thus began also the Count of Time. \n",
      "\n",
      "But as the ages drew on to the hour appointed by \n",
      "lluvatar for the coming of the Firstborn, Middle-earth lay in a \n",
      "twilight beneath the stars that Varda had wrought in the \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "ages forgotten of her labours in Ea. And in the darkness \n",
      "Melkor dwelt, and still often walked abroad, in many shapes \n",
      "of power and fear, and he wielded cold and fire, from the \n",
      "tops of the mountains to the deep furnaces that are beneath \n",
      "them; and whatsoever was cruel or violent or deadly in \n",
      "those days is laid to his charge. \n",
      "\n",
      "From the beauty and bliss of Valinor the Valar came \n",
      "seldom over the mountains to Middle-earth, but gave to the \n",
      "land beyond the Pelori their care and their love. And in the \n",
      "midst of the Blessed Realm were the mansions of Aule, \n",
      "and there he laboured long. For in the making of all things \n",
      "in that land he had the chief part, and he wrought there \n",
      "many beautiful and shapely works both openly and in \n",
      "secret. Of him comes the lore and knowledge of the Earth \n",
      "and of an things that it contains: whether the lore of those \n",
      "that make not, but seek only for the understanding of what \n",
      "is, or the lore of an craftsmen: the weaver, the shaper of \n",
      "wood, and the worker in metals; and the tiller and \n",
      "husbandman also, though these last and all that deal with \n",
      "things that grow and bear fruit must look also to the spouse \n",
      "of Aule, Yavanna Kementari. Aule it is who is named the \n",
      "Friend of the Noldor, for of him they learned much in after \n",
      "days, and they are the most skilled of the Elves; and in their \n",
      "own fashion, according to the gifts which lluvatar gave to \n",
      "them, they added much to his teaching, delighting to \n",
      "tongues and in scripts, and in the figures of broidery, of \n",
      "drawing, and of carving. The Noldor also it was who first \n",
      "achieved the making of gems; and the fairest of an gems \n",
      "were the Silmarils, and they are lost. \n",
      "\n",
      "But Manwe Sulimo, highest and holiest of the Valar, \n",
      "sat upon the borders of Aman, forsaking not in his thought \n",
      "the Outer Lands. For his throne was set in majesty upon the \n",
      "pinnacle of Taniquetil, the highest of the mountains of the \n",
      "world, standing upon the margin of the sea. Spirits in the \n",
      "shape of hawks and eagles flew ever to and from his halls; \n",
      "and their eyes could see to the depths of the seas, and \n",
      "pierce the hidden caverns beneath the world. Thus they \n",
      "brought word to him of well nigh all that passed in Arda; yet \n",
      "some things were hidden even from the eyes of Manwe and \n",
      "the servants of Manwe, for where Melkor sat in his dark \n",
      "thought impenetrable shadows lay. \n",
      "\n",
      "Manwe has no thought for his own honour, and is not \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "jealous of his power, but rules all to peace. The Vanyar he \n",
      "loved best of all the Elves, and of him they received song \n",
      "and poetry; for poetry is the delight of Manwe, and the song \n",
      "of words is his music. His raiment is blue, and blue is the \n",
      "fire of his eyes, and his sceptre is of sapphire, which the \n",
      "Noldor wrought for him; and he was appointed to be the \n",
      "vicegerent of lluvatar, King of the world of Valar and Elves \n",
      "and Men, and the chief defence against the evil of Melkor. \n",
      "With Manwe dwelt Varda the most beautiful, she who in the \n",
      "Sindarin tongue is named Elbereth, Queen of the Valar, \n",
      "maker of the stars; and with than were a great host of \n",
      "spirits in blessedness. \n",

      "But Ulmo was alone, and he abode not in Valinor, nor \n",
      "ever came thither unless there were need for a great \n",
      "council; he dwelt from the beginning of Arda in the Outer \n",
      "Ocean, and still he dwells there. Thence he governs the \n",
      "flowing of all waters, and the ebbing, the courses of an \n",
      "rivers and the replenishment of Springs, the distilling of all \n",
      "dews and rain in every land beneath the sky. In the deep \n",
      "places he gives thought to music great and terrible; and the \n",
      "echo of that music runs through all the veins of the world in \n",
      "sorrow and in joy; for it joyful is the fountain that rises in the \n",
      "sun, its springs are in the wells of sorrow unfathomed at the \n",
      "foundations of the Earth. The Teleri learned much of Ulmo, \n",
      "and for this reason their music has both sadness and \n",
      "enchantment. Salmar came with him to Arda, he who made \n",
      "the horns of Ulmo that none may ever forget who once has \n",
      "heard them; and Osse and Uinen also, to whom he gave \n",
      "the government of the waves and the movements of the \n",
      "Inner Seas, and many other spirits beside. And thus it was \n",
      "by the power of Ulmo that even under the darkness of \n",
      "Melkor life coursed still through many secret lodes, and the \n",
      "Earth did not die; and to all who were lost in that darkness \n",
      "or wandered far from the light of the Valar the ear of Ulmo \n",
      "was ever open; nor has he ever forsaken Middle-earth, and \n",
      "whatsoever may since have befallen of ruin or of change he \n",
      "has not ceased to take thought for it, and will not until the \n",
      "end of days. \n",
      "\n",
      "And in that time of dark Yavanna also was unwilling \n",
      "utterly to forsake the Outer Lands; for all things teat grow \n",
      "are dear to her, and she mourned for the works that she \n",
      "had begun in Middle-earth but Melkor had marred. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore leaving the house of Aule and the flowering \n",
      "meads of Valinor she would come at times and heal the \n",
      "hurts of Melkor; and returning she would ever urge the Valar \n",
      "to that war with his evil dominion that they must surely wage \n",
      "ere the coming of die Firstborn. And Orome tamer of \n",
      "beasts would ride too at whiles in the darkness of the unlit \n",
      "forests; as a mighty hunter he came with spear and bow, \n",
      "pursuing to the death the monsters and fell creatures of the \n",
      "kingdom of Melkor, and his white horse Nahar shone like \n",
      "silver in the shadows. Then the sleeping earth trembled at \n",
      "the beat of his golden hooves, and in the twilight of the \n",
      "world Orome would sound the Valaroma his great horn \n",
      "upon the plains of Arda; whereat the mountains echoed, \n",
      "and the shadows of evil fled away, and Melkor himself \n",
      "quailed in Utumno, foreboding the wrath to come. But even \n",
      "as Orome passed the servants of Melkor would gather \n",
      "again; and the lands were filled with shadows and deceit. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now all is said concerning the manner of the Earth and \n",
      "its rulers in the beginning of days, and ere the world \n",
      "became such as the Children of lluvatar have known it. For \n",
      "Elves and Men are the Children of lluvatar; and since they \n",
      "understood not fully that theme by which the Children \n",
      "entered into the Music, none of the Ainur dared to add \n",
      "anything to their fashion. For which reason the Valar are to \n",
      "these kindreds rather their elders and their chieftains than \n",
      "their masters; and if ever in their dealings with Elves and \n",
      "Men the Ainur have endeavoured to force them when they \n",
      "would not be guided, seldom has this turned to good, \n",
      "howsoever good the intent. The dealings of the Ainur have \n",
      "indeed been mostly with the Elves, for lluvatar made them \n",
      "more like in nature to the Ainur, though less in might and \n",
      "stature; whereas to Men he gave strange gifts. \n",
      "\n",
      "For it is said that after the departure of the Valar there \n",
      "was silence, and for an age lluvatar sat alone in thought. \n",
      "Then he spoke and said: 'Behold I love the Earth, which \n",
      "shall be a mansion for the Quendi and the Atani! But the \n",
      "Quendi shall be the fairest of all earthly creatures, and they \n",
      "shall have and shall conceive and bring forth more beauty \n",
      "than all my Children; and they shall have the greater bliss in \n",
      "this world. But to the Atani I will give a new gift.' Therefore \n",
      "he willed that the hearts of Men should seek beyond the \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "world and should find no rest therein; but they should have a \n",
      "virtue to shape their life, amid the powers and chances of \n",
      "the world, beyond the Music of the Ainur, which is as fate to \n",
      "all things else; and of their operation everything should be, \n",
      "in form and deed, completed, and the world fulfilled unto the \n",
      "last and smallest. \n",
      "\n",
      "But liuvatar knew that Men, being set amid the turmoils \n",
      "of the powers of the world, would stray often, and would not \n",
      "use their gifts in harmony; and he said: \"These too in their \n",
      "time shall find that all that they do redounds at the end only \n",
      "to the glory of my work.' Yet the Elves believe that Men are \n",
      "often a grief to Manwe, who knows most of the mind of \n",
      "liuvatar; for it seems to the Elves that Men resemble Melkor \n",
      "most of all the Ainur, although he has ever feared and hated \n",
      "them, even those that served him. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is one with this gift of freedom that the children of \n",
      "Men dwell only a short space in the world alive, and are not \n",
      "bound to it, and depart soon whither the Elves know not. \n",
      "Whereas the Elves remain until the end of days, and their \n",
      "love of the Earth and all the world is more single and more \n",
      "poignant therefore, and as the years lengthen ever more \n",
      "sorrowful. For the Elves die not till tile world dies, unless \n",
      "they are slain or waste in grief (and to both these seeming \n",
      "deaths they are subject); neither does age subdue their \n",
      "strength, unless one grow weary often thousand centuries; \n",
      "and dying they are gathered to the halls of Mandos in \n",
      "Valinor, whence they may in time return. But the sons of \n",
      "Men die indeed, and leave the world; wherefore they are \n",
      "called the Guests, or the Strangers. Death is their fate, the \n",
      "gift of liuvatar, which as Time wears even the Powers shall \n",
      "envy. But Melkor has cast his shadow upon it, and \n",
      "confounded it with darkness, and brought forth evil out of \n",
      "good, and fear out of hope. Yet of old the Valar declared to \n",
      "the Elves in Valinor that Men shall join in the Second Music \n",
      "of the Ainur; whereas liuvatar has not revealed what he \n",
      "purposes for the Elves after the World's end, and Melkor \n",
      "has not discovered it. \n",

      "Chapter 2 \n",
      "\n",
      "Of Aule and Yavanna \n",
      "\n",
      "It is told that in their beginning the Dwarves were made \n",
      "by Aule in the darkness of Middle-earth; for so greatly did \n",
      "Aule desire the coming of the Children, to have learners to \n",
      "whom he could teach his lore and his crafts, that he was \n",
      "unwilling to await the fulfilment of the designs of lluvatar. \n",
      "And Aule made the Dwarves even as they still are, because \n",
      "the forms of the Children who were to come were unclear to \n",
      "his mind, and because the power of Melkor was yet over \n",
      "the Earth; and he wished therefore that they should be \n",
      "strong and unyielding. But fearing that the other Valar might \n",
      "blame his work, he wrought in secret: and he made first the \n",
      "Seven Fathers of the Dwarves in a hall under the mountains \n",
      "in Middle-earth. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now lluvatar knew what was done, and in the very hour \n",
      "that Aule's work was complete, and he was pleased, and \n",
      "began to instruct the Dwarves in the speech that he had \n",
      "devised for them, lluvatar spoke to him; and Aule heard his \n",
      "voice and was silent. And the voice of lluvatar said to him: \n",
      "'Why hast thou done this? Why dost thou attempt a thing \n",
      "which thou knowest is beyond thy power and thy authority? \n",
      "For thou hast from me as a gift thy own bring only, and no \n",
      "more; and therefore the creatures of thy hand and mind can \n",
      "live only by that being, moving when thou thinkest to move \n",
      "them, and if thy thought be elsewhere, standing idle. Is that \n",
      "thy desire?' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Aule answered: 'I did not desire such lordship. I \n",
      "desired things other than I am, to love and to teach them, so \n",
      "that they too might perceive the beauty of Ea, which thou \n",
      "hast caused to be. For it seemed to me that there is great \n",
      "room in Arda for many things that might rejoice in it, yet it is \n",
      "for the most part empty still, and dumb. And in my \n",
      "impatience I have fallen into folly. Yet the making of thing is \n",
      "in my heart from my own making by thee; and the child of \n",
      "little understanding that makes a play of the deeds of his \n",
      "father may do so without thought of mockery, but because \n",
      "he is the son of his father. But what shall I do now, so that \n",
      "thou be not angry with me for ever? As a child to his father, I \n",
      "offer to thee these things, the work of the hands which thou \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hast made. Do with them what thou wilt. But should I not \n",
      "rather destroy the work of my presumption?' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Aule took up a great hammer to smite the \n",
      "Dwarves; and he wept. But lluvatar had compassion upon \n",
      "Aule and his desire, because of his humility; and the \n",
      "Dwarves shrank from the hammer and wore afraid, and \n",
      "they bowed down their heads and begged for mercy. And \n",
      "the voice of lluvatar said to Aule: 'Thy offer I accepted even \n",
      "as it was made. Dost thou not see that these things have \n",
      "now a life of their own, and speak with their own voices? \n",
      "Else they would not have flinched from thy blow, nor from \n",
      "any command of thy will.' Then Aule cast down his hammer \n",
      "and was glad, and he gave thanks to lluvatar, saying: 'May \n",
      "Eru bless my work and amend it!' \n",
      "\n",
      "But lluvatar spoke again and said: 'Even as I gave \n",
      "being to the thoughts of the Ainur at the beginning of the \n",
      "World, so now I have taken up thy desire and given to it a \n",
      "place therein; but in no other way will I amend thy \n",
      "handiwork, and as thou hast made it, so shall it be. But I will \n",
      "not suffer this: that these should come before the Firstborn \n",
      "of my design, nor that thy impatience should be rewarded. \n",
      "They shall sleep now in the darkness under stone, and shall \n",
      "not come forth until the Firstborn have awakened upon \n",
      "Earth; and until that time thou and they shall wait, though \n",
      "long it seem. But when the time comes I will awaken them, \n",
      "and they shall be to thee as children; and often strife shall \n",
      "arise between thine and mine, the children of my adoption \n",
      "and the children of my choice.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Aule took the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves, and \n",
      "laid them to rest in far-sundered places; and he returned to \n",
      "Valinor, and waited while the long years lengthened. \n",
      "\n",
      "Since they were to come in the days of the power of \n",
      "Melkor, Aule made the Dwarves strong to endure. \n",
      "Therefore they are stone-hard, stubborn, fast in friendship \n",
      "and in enmity, and they suffer toil and hanger and hurt of \n",
      "body more hardily than all other speaking peoples; and they \n",
      "live long, far beyond the span of Men, yet not for ever. \n",
      "Aforetime it was held among the Elves in Middle-earth that \n",
      "dying the Dwarves returned to the earth and the stone of \n",
      "which they were made; yet that is not their own belief. For \n",
      "they say that Aule the Maker, whom they call Mahal, cares \n",
      "for them, and gathers them to Mandos in halls set apart; \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "and that he declared to their Fathers of old that lluvatar will \n",
      "hallow them and give them a place among the Children in \n",
      "the End. Then their part shall be to serve Aule and to aid \n",
      "him in the remaking of Arda after the Last Battle. They say \n",
      "also that the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves return to live \n",
      "again in their own kin and to bear once more their ancient \n",
      "names: of whom Durin was the most renowned in after \n",
      "ages, father of that kindred most friendly to the Elves, \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Now when Aule laboured in the making of the Dwarves \n",
      "he kept this work hidden from the other Valar; but at last he \n",
      "opened his mind to Yavanna and told her of all that had \n",
      "come to pass. Then Yavanna said to him: 'Em is merciful. \n",
      "Now I see that thy heart rejoiceth, as indeed it may; for thou \n",
      "hast received not only forgiveness but bounty. Yet because \n",
      "thou hiddest this thought from me until its achievement, thy \n",
      "children will have little love for the things of my love. They \n",
      "will love first the things made by their own hands, as doth \n",
      "their father. They will delve in the earth, and the things that \n",
      "grow and live upon the earth they will not heed. Many a tree \n",
      "shall feel the bite of their iron without pity.' \n",
      "\n",
      "But Aule answered: That shall also be true of the \n",
      "Children of lluvatar; for they will eat and they will build. And \n",
      "though the things of thy realm have worth in themselves, \n",
      "and would have worth if no Children were to come, yet Eru \n",
      "will give them dominion, and they shall use all that they find \n",
      "in Arda: though not, by the purpose of Eru, without respect \n",
      "or without gratitude.' \n",
      "\n",
      "'Not unless Melkor darken their hearts,' said Yavanna. \n",
      "And she was not appeased, but grieved in heart, fearing \n",
      "what might be done upon Middle-earth in days to come. \n",
      "Therefore she went before Manwe, and she did not betray \n",
      "the counsel of Aule, but she said: 'King of Arda, is it true, as \n",
      "Aule hath said to me, that the Children when they come \n",
      "shall have dominion over all the things of my labour, to do \n",
      "as they will therewith?' \n",
      "\n",
      "'It is true,' said Manwe. 'But why dost thou ask, for thou \n",
      "hadst no need of the teaching of Aule?' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Yavanna was silent and looked into her own \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Is it not enough that Melkor should have marred so many? \n",

      "\n",
      "'All have their worth,' said Yavanna, 'and each \n",
      "contributes to the worth of the others. But the kelvar can \n",
      "flee or defend themselves, whereas the olvar that grow \n",
      "cannot. And among these I hold trees dear. Long in the \n",
      "growing, swift shall they be in the felling, and unless they \n",
      "pay toll with fruit upon bough little mourned in their passing. \n",
      "So I see in my thought. Would that the trees might speak on \n",
      "behalf of all things that have roots, and punish those that \n",

      "\n",
      "'This is a strange thought,' said Manwe. \n",
      "\n",
      "'Yet it was in the Song,' said Yavanna. 'For while thou \n",

      "poured out the rains, I lifted up the branches of great trees \n",
      "to receive them, and some sang to lluvatar amid the wind \n",

      "\n",
      "Then Manwe sat silent, and the thought of Yavanna that \n",
      "she had put into his heart grew and unfolded; and it was \n",
      "beheld by lluvatar. Then it seemed to Manwe that the Song \n",
      "rose once more about him, and he heeded now many \n",
      "things therein that though he had heard them he had not \n",
      "heeded before. And at last the Vision was renewed, but it \n",
      "was not now remote, for he was himself within it, and yet he \n",
      "saw that all was upheld by the hand of lluvatar; and the hand \n",
      "entered in, and from it came forth many wonders that had \n",
      "until then been hidden from him in the hearts of the Ainur. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Manwe awoke, and he went down to Yavanna \n",
      "upon Ezellohar, and he sat beside her beneath the Two \n",
      "Trees. And Manwe said: 'O Kementari, Eru hath spoken, \n",
      "saying: \"Do then any of the Valar suppose that I did not \n",
      "hear all the Song, even the least sound of the least voice? \n",
      "Behold! When the Children awake, then the thought of \n",
      "Yavanna will awake also, and it will summon spirits from \n",
      "afar, and they will go among the kelvar and the olvar, and \n",
      "some will dwell therein, and be held in reverence, and their \n",
      "just anger shall be feared. For a time: while the Firstborn \n",
      "are in their power, and while the Secondborn are young.\" \n",
      "But dost them not now remember, Kementari, that thy \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "thought sang not always alone? Did not thy thought and \n",
      "mine meet also, so that we took wing together like great \n",
      "birds that soar above the clouds? That also shall come to \n",
      "be by the heed of lluvatar, and before the Children awake \n",
      "there shall go forth with wings like the wind the Eagles of \n",
      "the Lords of the West.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Yavanna was glad, and she stood up, reaching \n",
      "her arms towards the heavens, and she said: 'High shall \n",
      "climb the trees of Kementari, that the Eagles of the King \n",
      "may house therein!' \n",
      "\n",
      "But Manwe rose also, and it seemed that he stood to \n",
      "such a height that his voice came down to Yavanna as from \n",
      "the paths of the winds. \n",
      "\n",
      "'Nay,' he said, 'only the trees of Aule will be tall enough. \n",
      "In the mountains the Eagles shall house, and hear the \n",

      "Then Manwe and Yavanna parted for that time, and \n",

      "took the silver dews from the vats of Telperion, and \n",

      "Elentari above all the Valar. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the changes of the world the shapes of lands and of \n",
      "seas have been broken and remade; rivers have not kept \n",

      "the Elves that it lay far off in the east of Middle-earth, and \n",
      "northward, and it was a bay in the Inland Sea of Helcar; and \n",
      "that sea stood where aforetime the roots of the mountain of \n",
      "llluin had been before Melkor overthrew it Many waters \n",
      "flowed down thither from heights in the east, and the first \n",
      "sound that was heard by the Elves was the sound of water \n",
      "flowing, and the sound of water falling over stone. \n",
      "\n",
      "Long they dwelt in their first home by the water under \n",
      "stars, and they walked the Earth in wonder; and they began \n",
      "to make speech and to give names to all things that they \n",
      "perceived. Themselves they named the Quendi, signifying \n",
      "those that speak with voices; for as yet they had met no \n",
      "other living things that spoke or sang. \n",
      "\n",
      "And on a time it chanced that Orome rode eastward in \n",
      "his hunting, and he turned north by the shores of Helcar and \n",
      "passed under the shadows of the Orocarni, the Mountains \n",
      "of the East. Then on a sudden Nahar set up a great \n",
      "neighing, and stood still. And Orome wondered and sat \n",
      "silent, and it seemed to him that in the quiet of the land \n",
      "under the stars he heard afar off many voices singing. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus it was that the Valar found at last, as it were by \n",

      "they were beings sudden and marvellous and unforeseen; \n",
      "for so it shall ever be with the Valar. From without the \n",
      "World, though all things may be forethought in music or \n",
      "foreshown in vision from afar, to those who enter verily into \n",
      "Ea each in its time shall be met at unawares as something \n",
      "new and unforetold. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the beginning the Elder Children of lluvatar were \n",
      "stronger and greater than they have since become; but not \n",
      "more fair, for though the beauty of the Quendi in the days of \n",
      "their youth was beyond all other beauty that lluvatar has \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "caused to be, it has not perished, but lives in the West, and \n",
      "sorrow and wisdom have enriched it. And Orome loved the \n",
      "Quendi, and named them in their own tongue Eldar, the \n",
      "people of the stars; but that name was after borne only by \n",
      "those who followed him upon the westward road. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet many of the Quendi were filled with dread at his \n",
      "coming; and this was the doing of Melkor. For by after- \n",
      "knowledge the wise declare that Melkor, ever watchful, was \n",
      "first aware of the awakening of the Quendi, and sent \n",
      "shadows and evil spirits to spy upon them and waylay them. \n",
      "So it came to pass, some years ere the coming of Orome, \n",
      "that if any of the Elves strayed far abroad, alone or few \n",
      "together, they would often vanish, and never return; and the \n",
      "Quendi said that the Hunter had caught them, and they \n",
      "were afraid. And indeed the most ancient songs of the \n",
      "Elves, of which echoes are remembered still in the West, \n",
      "tell of the shadow-shapes that walked in the hills above \n",
      "Cuivienen, or would pass suddenly over the stars; and of \n",
      "the dark Rider upon his wild horse that pursued those that \n",
      "wandered to take them and devour them. Now Melkor \n",
      "greatly hated and feared the riding of Orome, and either he \n",
      "sent indeed his dark servants as riders, or he set lying \n",
      "whispers abroad, for the purpose that the Quendi should \n",
      "shun Orome, if ever they should meet. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus it was that when Nahar neighed and Orome \n",
      "indeed came among them, some of the Quendi hid \n",
      "themselves, and some fled and were lost. But those that \n",
      "had courage, and stayed, perceived swiftly that the Great \n",
      "Rider was no shape out of darkness; for the light of Aman \n",
      "was in his face, and all the noblest of the Elves were drawn \n",
      "towards it. \n",
      "\n",
      "But of those unhappy ones who were ensnared by \n",
      "Melkor little is known of a certainty. For who of the living has \n",
      "descended into the pits of Utumno, or has explored the \n",
      "darkness of the counsels of Melkor? Yet this is held true by \n",
      "the wise of Eressea, that all those of the Quendi who came \n",
      "into the hands of Melkor, ere Utumno was broken, were put \n",
      "there in prison, and by slow arts of cruelty were corrupted \n",
      "and enslaved; and thus did Melkor breed the hideous race \n",
      "of the Ores in envy and mockery of the Elves, of whom they \n",
      "were afterwards the bitterest foes. For the Ores had life and \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "multiplied after the manner of the Children of lluvatar; and \n",
      "naught that had life of its own, nor the semblance of life, \n",
      "could ever Melkor make since his rebellion in the \n",
      "Ainulindale before the Beginning: so say the wise. And \n",
      "deep in their dark hearts the Ores loathed the Master whom \n",
      "they served in fear, the maker only of their misery. This it \n",
      "may be was the vilest deed of Melkor, and the most hateful \n",
      "to lluvatar. \n",
      "\n",
      "Orome tarried a while among the Quendi, and then \n",
      "swiftly he rode back over land and sea to Valinor and \n",
      "brought the tidings to Valmar; and he spoke of the shadows \n",
      "that troubled Cuivienen. Then the Valar rejoiced, and yet \n",
      "they were in doubt amid their joy; and they debated long \n",
      "what counsel it were best to take for the guarding of the \n",
      "Quendi from the shadow of Melkor. But Orome returned at \n",
      "once to Middle-earth and abode with the Elves. \n",
      "\n",
      "Manwe sat long in thought upon Taniquetil, and he \n",
      "sought the counsel of lluvatar. And coming then down to \n",
      "Valmar he summoned the Valar to the Ring of Doom, and \n",
      "thither came even Ulmo from the Outer Sea. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Manwe said to the Valar: This is the counsel of \n",
      "lluvatar in my heart: that we should take up again the \n",
      "mastery of Arda, at whatsoever cost, and deliver the \n",
      "Quendi from the shadow of Melkor.' Then Tulkas was glad; \n",
      "butAule was grieved, foreboding the hurts of the world that \n",
      "must come of that strife. But the Valar made ready and \n",
      "came forth from Aman in strength of war, resolving to \n",
      "assault the fortresses of Melkor and make an end. Never \n",
      "did Melkor forget that this war was made for the sake of the \n",
      "Elves, and that they were the cause of his downfall. Yet they \n",
      "had no part in those deeds, and they know little of the riding \n",
      "of the might of the West against the North in the beginning \n",
      "of their days. \n",
      "\n",
      "Melkor met the onset of the Valar in the North-west of \n",
      "Middle-earth, and all that region was much broken. But the \n",
      "first victory of the hosts of the West was swift, and the \n",
      "servants of Melkor fled before them to Utumno. Then the \n",
      "Valar passed over Middle-earth, and they set a guard over \n",
      "Cuivienen; and thereafter the Quendi knew nothing of the \n",
      "great Battle of the Powers, save that the Earth shook and \n",
      "groaned beneath them, and the waters were moved, and in \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the north there were lights as of mighty fires. Long and \n",
      "grievous was the siege of Utumno, and many battles were \n",
      "fought before its gates of which naught but the rumour is \n",
      "known to the Elves. In that time the shape of Middle-earth \n",
      "was changed, and the Great Sea that sundered it from \n",
      "Aman grew wide and deep; and it broke in upon the coasts \n",
      "and made a deep gulf to the southward. Many lesser bays \n",
      "were made between the Great Gulf and Helcaraxe far in the \n",
      "north, where Middle-earth and Aman came nigh together. \n",
      "Of these the Bay of Balar was the chief; and into it the \n",
      "mighty river Sirion flowed down from the new-raised \n",
      "highlands northwards: Dorthonion, and the mountains about \n",
      "Hithlum. The lands of the far north were all made desolate \n",
      "in those days; for there Utumno was delved exceeding \n",
      "deep, and its pits were filled with fires and with great hosts \n",
      "of the servants of Melkor. \n",
      "\n",
      "But at the last the gates of Utumno were broken and \n",
      "the halls unroofed, and Melkor took refuge in the uttermost \n",
      "pit. Then Tulkas stood forth as champion of the Valar and \n",
      "wrestled with him, and cast him upon his face; and he was \n",
      "bound with the chain Angainor that Aule had wrought, and \n",
      "led captive; and the world had peace for a long age. \n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless the Valar did not discover all the mighty \n",
      "vaults and caverns hidden with deceit far under the \n",
      "fortresses of Angband and Utumno. Many evil things still \n",
      "lingered there, and others were dispersed and fled into the \n",
      "dark and roamed in the waste places of the world, awaiting \n",
      "a more evil hour; and Sauron they did not find. \n",
      "\n",
      "But when the Battle was ended and from the ruin of the \n",
      "North great clouds arose and hid the stars, the Valar drew \n",
      "Melkor back to Valinor, bound hand and foot, and blindfold; \n",
      "and he was brought to the Ring of Doom. There he lay upon \n",
      "his face before the feet of Manwe and sued for pardon; but \n",
      "his prayer was denied, and he was cast into prison in the \n",
      "fastness of Mandos, whence none can escape, neither \n",
      "Vala, nor Elf, nor mortal Man. Vast and strong are those \n",
      "halls, and they were built in the west of the land of Aman. \n",
      "There was Melkor doomed to abide for three ages long, \n",
      "before his cause should be tried anew, or he should plead \n",
      "again for pardon. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then again the Valar were gathered in council, and \n",
      "they were divided in debate. For some, and of those Ulmo \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "was the chief, held that the Quendi should be left free to \n",
      "walk as they would in Middle-earth, and with their gifts of \n",
      "skill to order all the lands and heal their hurts. But the most \n",
      "part feared for the Quendi in the dangerous world amid the \n",
      "deceits of the starlit dusk; and they were filled moreover \n",
      "with the love of the beauty of the Elves and desired their \n",
      "fellowship. At the last, therefore, the Valar summoned the \n",
      "Quendi to Valinor, there to be gathered at the knees of the \n",
      "Powers in the light of the Trees for ever; and Mandos broke \n",
      "his silence, saying: 'So it is doomed.' From this summons \n",
      "came many woes that afterwards befell. \n",
      "\n",
      "But the Elves were at first unwilling to hearken to the \n",
      "summons, for they had as yet seen the Valar only in their \n",
      "wrath as they went to war, save Orome alone; and they \n",
      "were filled with dread. Therefore Orome was sent again to \n",
      "them, and he chose from among them ambassadors who \n",
      "should go to Valinor and speak for their people; and these \n",
      "were Ingwe, Finwe and Elwe, who afterwards were kings. \n",
      "And coming they were filled with awe by the glory and \n",
      "majesty of the Valar, and desired greatly the light and \n",
      "splendour of the Trees. Then Orome brought them back to \n",
      "Cuivienen, and they spoke before their people, and \n",
      "counselled them to heed the summons of the Valar and \n",
      "remove into the West \n",
      "\n",
      "Then befell the first sundering of the Elves. For the \n",
      "kindred of Ingwe, and the most part of the kindreds of \n",
      "Finwe and Elwe, were swayed by the words of their lords, \n",
      "and were willing to depart and follow Orome; and these \n",
      "were known ever after as the Eldar, by the name that \n",
      "Orome gave to the Elves in the beginning, in their own \n",
      "tongue. But many refused the summons, preferring the \n",
      "starlight and the wide spaces of Middle-earth to the rumour \n",
      "of the Trees; and these are the Avari, the Unwilling, and \n",
      "they were sundered in that time from the Eldar, and met \n",
      "never again until many ages were past. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Eldar prepared now a great march from their first \n",
      "homes in the east; and they were arrayed in three hosts. \n",
      "The smallest host and the first to set forth was led by Ingwe, \n",
      "the most high lord of all the Elvish race. He entered into \n",
      "Valinor and sits at the feet of the Powers, and all Elves \n",
      "revere his name; but he came never back, nor looked again \n",
      "upon Middle-earth. The Vanyar were his people; they are \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the Fair Elves, the beloved of Manwe and Varda, and few \n",
      "among Men have spoken with them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Next came the Noldor, a name of wisdom, the people \n",
      "of Finwe. They are the Deep Elves, the friends of Aule; and \n",
      "they are renowned in song, for they fought and laboured \n",
      "long and grievously in the northern lands of old. \n",
      "\n",
      "The greatest host came last, and they are named the \n",
      "Teleri, for they tarried on the road, and were not wholly of a \n",
      "mind to pass from the dusk to the light of Valinor. In water \n",
      "they had great delight, and those that came at last to the \n",
      "western shores were enamoured of the sea. The Sea-elves \n",
      "therefore they became in the land of Aman, the Falmari, for \n",
      "they made music beside the breaking waves. Two lords \n",
      "they had, for their numbers were great: Elwe Singollo \n",
      "(which signifies Greymantle) and Olwe his brother. \n",
      "\n",
      "These were the three kindreds of the Eldalie, who \n",
      "passing at length into the uttermost West in the days of the \n",
      "Trees are called the Calaquendi, Elves of the Light. But \n",
      "others of the Eldar there were who set out indeed upon the \n",
      "westward march, but became lost upon the long road, or \n",
      "turned aside, or lingered on the shores of Middle-earth; and \n",
      "these were for the most part of the kindred of the Teleri, as \n",
      "is told hereafter. They dwelt by the sea or wandered in the \n",
      "woods and mountains of the world, yet their hearts were \n",
      "turned towards the West. Those Elves the Calaquendi call \n",
      "the Umanyar, since they came never to the land of Aman \n",
      "and the Blessed Realm; but the Umanyar and the Avari \n",
      "alike they call the Moriquendi, Elves of the Darkness, for \n",
      "they never beheld the Light that was before the Sun and \n",
      "Moon. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is told that when the hosts of the Eldalie departed \n",
      "from Cuivienen Orome rode at their head upon Nahar, his \n",
      "white horse shod with gold; and passing northward about \n",
      "the Sea of Helcar they turned towards the west. Before \n",
      "them great clouds hung still black in the North above the \n",
      "ruins of war, and the stars in that region were hidden. Then \n",
      "not a few grew afraid and repented, and turned back, and \n",
      "are forgotten. \n",
      "\n",
      "Long and slow was the march of the Eldar into the \n",
      "west, for the leagues of Middle-earth were uncounted, and \n",
      "weary and pathless. Nor did the Eldar desire to hasten, for \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "they were filled with wonder at all that they saw, and by \n",
      "many lands and rivers they wished to abide; and though all \n",
      "were yet willing to wander, many feared rather their \n",
      "journey's end than hoped for it Therefore whenever Orome \n",
      "departed, having at times other matters to heed, they halted \n",
      "and went forward no more, until he returned to guide them. \n",
      "And it came to pass after many years of journeying in this \n",
      "manner that the Eldar took their course through a forest, \n",
      "and they came to a great river, wider than any they had yet \n",
      "seen; and beyond it were mountains whose sharp horns \n",
      "seemed to pierce the realm of the stars. This river, it is \n",
      "said, was even the river which was after called Anduin the \n",
      "Great, and was ever the frontier of the west-lands of \n",
      "Middle-earth. But the mountains were the Hithaeglir, the \n",
      "Towers of Mist upon the borders of Eriador; yet they were \n",
      "taller and more terrible in those days, and were reared by \n",
      "Melkorto hinder the riding of Orome. Now the Teleri abode \n",
      "long on the east bank of that river and wished to remain \n",
      "there, but the Vanyar and me Noldor passed over it, and \n",
      "Orome led them into the passes of the mountains. And \n",
      "when Orome was gone forward the Teleri looked upon the \n",
      "shadowy heights and were afraid. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then one arose in the host of Olwe, which was ever the \n",
      "hindmost on the road; Lenwe he was called. He forsook the \n",
      "westward march, and led away a numerous people, \n",
      "southwards down the great river, and they passed out of the \n",
      "knowledge of their kin until long years were past. Those \n",
      "were the Nandor; and they became a people apart, unlike \n",
      "their kin, save that they loved water, and dwelt most beside \n",
      "falls and running streams. Greater knowledge they had of \n",
      "living things, tree and herb, bird and beast, than all other \n",
      "Elves. In after years Denethor, son of Lenwe, turned again \n",
      "west at last, and led a part of that people over the \n",
      "mountains into Beleriand ere the rising of the Moon. \n",
      "\n",
      "At length the Vanyar and the Noldor came over Ered \n",
      "Luin, the Blue Mountains, between Eriador and the \n",
      "westernmost land of Middle-earth, which the Elves after \n",
      "named Beleriand; and the foremost companies passed \n",
      "over the Vale of Sirion and came down to the shores of the \n",
      "Great Sea between Drengist and the Bay of Balar. But \n",
      "when they beheld it great fear came upon them, and many \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "withdrew into the woods and highlands of Beleriand. Then \n",
      "Orome departed, and returned to Valinor to seek the \n",
      "counsel of Manwe, and left them. \n",
      "\n",
      "And the host of the Teleri passed over the Misty \n",
      "Mountains, and crossed the wide lands of Eriador, being \n",
      "urged on by Elwe Singollo, for he was eager to return to \n",
      "Valinor and the Light that he had beheld; and he wished not \n",
      "to be sundered from the Noldor, for he had great friendship \n",
      "with Finwe their lord. Thus after many years the Teleri also \n",
      "came at last over Ered Luin into the eastern regions of \n",

      "Melian was a Maia, of the race of the Valar. She dwelt \n",
      "in the gardens of Lorien, and among all his people there \n",
      "were none more beautiful than Melian, nor more wise, nor \n",
      "more skilled in songs of enchantment. It is told that the \n",
      "Valar would leave their works, and the birds of Valinor their \n",
      "mirth, that the bells of Valmar were silent and the fountains \n",
      "ceased to flow, when at the mingling of the lights Melian \n",
      "sang in Lorien. Nightingales went always with her, and she \n",
      "taught them their song; and she loved the deep shadows of \n",
      "the great trees. She was akin before the World was made \n",
      "to Yavanna herself; and in that time when the Quendi awoke \n",
      "beside the waters of Cuivienen she departed from Valinor \n",
      "and came to the Hither Lands, and there she filled the \n",
      "silence of Middle-earth before the dawn with her voice and \n",

      "\n",
      "Now when their journey was near its end, as has been \n",
      "told, the people of the Teleri rested long in East Beleriand, \n",
      "beyond the River Gelion; and at that time many of the \n",
      "Noldor still lay to the westward, in those forests that were \n",
      "afterwards named Neldoreth and Region. Elwe, lord of the \n",
      "Teleri, went often through the great woods to seek out \n",
      "Finwe his friend in the dwellings of the Noldor; and it \n",
      "chanced on a time that he came alone to the starlit wood of \n",
      "Nan Elmoth, and there suddenly he heard the song of \n",
      "nightingales. Then an enchantment fell on him, and he \n",
      "stood still; and afar off beyond the voices of the lomelindi \n",
      "he heard the voice of Melian, and it filled all his heart with \n",
      "wonder and desire. He forgot then utterly all his people and \n",
      "all the purposes of his mind, and following the birds under \n",
      "the shadow of the trees he passed deep into Nan Elmoth \n",
      "and was lost. But he came at last to a glade open to the \n",
      "stars, and there Melian stood; and out of the darkness he \n",
      "looked at her, and the light of Aman was in her face. \n",
      "\n",
      "She spoke no word; but being filled with love Elwe \n",
      "came to her and took her hand, and straightway a spell was \n",

      "In time the hosts of the Vanyar and the Noldor came to \n",

      "these shores, in the ancient days after the Battle of the \n",
      "Powers, bent ever westward, until in the northernmost parts \n",
      "of Arda only a narrow sea divided Aman, upon which \n",
      "Valinor was built, from the Hither Lands; but this narrow sea \n",
      "was filled with grinding ice, because of the violence of the \n",

      "the Eldalie into the far north, but brought them to the fair \n",
      "lands about the River Sirion, that afterwards were named \n",

      "words and the music which he made for them on his horns \n",
      "of shell their fear of the sea was turned rather to desire. \n",
      "Therefore Ulmo uprooted an island which long had stood \n",
      "alone amid the sea, far from either shore, since the tumults \n",

      "and the Noldor embarked upon that isle, and were drawn \n",
      "over the sea, and came at last to the long shores beneath \n",
      "the Mountains of Aman; and they entered Valinor and were \n",
      "welcomed to its bliss. But the eastern horn of the island, \n",
      "which was deep-grounded in the shoals off the mouths of \n",
      "Sirion, was broken asunder and remained behind and that, \n",
      "it is said, was the Isle of Balar, to which afterwards Osse \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "their peoples were gone, then many of the Teleri pressed \n",
      "on to the shores of Beleriand, and dwelt thereafter near the \n",
      "Mouths of Sirion, in longing for their friends that had \n",
      "departed; and they took Olwe, Elweâ€™s brother, to be their \n",
      "king. Long they remained by the coasts of the western sea, \n",
      "and Osse and Uinen came to them and befriended them; \n",
      "and Osse instructed them, sitting upon a rock near to the \n",
      "margin of the land, and of him they learned all manner of \n",
      "sea-lore and sea-music. Thus it came to be that the Teleri, \n",
      "who were from the beginning lovers of water, and the fairest \n",
      "singers of all the Elves, were after enamoured of the seas, \n",

      "proved now willing indeed; but great was the grief of Osse \n",
      "when Ulmo returned to the coasts of Beleriand, to bear \n",
      "them away to Valinor; for his care was for the seas of \n",
      "Middle-earth and the shores of the Hither Lands, and he \n",
      "was ill-pleased that the voices of the Teleri should be heard \n",
      "no more in his domain. Some he persuaded to remain; and \n",
      "those were the Falathrim, the Elves of the Falas, who in \n",
      "after days had dwellings at the havens of Brithombar and \n",
      "Eglarest, the first mariners in Middle-earth and the first \n",

      "called themselves Eglath, the Forsaken People. They dwelt \n",
      "in the woods and hills of Beleriand, rather than by the sea, \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Melian he beheld the light of Aman as in an unclouded \n",
      "mirror, and in that light he was content. His people gathered \n",
      "about him in joy, and they were amazed; for fair and noble \n",
      "as he had been, now he appeared as it were a lord of the \n",

      "Now Osse followed after the host of Olwe, and when \n",

      "begged Ulmo to stay their voyage. And Ulmo granted their \n",
      "request, and at his bidding Osse made fast the island and \n",
      "rooted it to the foundations of the sea. Ulmo did this the \n",
      "more readily for he understood the hearts of the Teleri, and \n",
      "in the council of the Valar he had spoken against the \n",
      "summons, thinking that it were better for the Quendi to \n",
      "remain in Middle-earth. The Valar were little pleased to \n",
      "learn what he had done; and Finwe grieved when the Teleri \n",
      "came not, and yet more when he learned that Elwe was \n",
      "forsaken, and knew that he should not see him again, \n",
      "unless it were in the halls of Mandos. But the island was not \n",
      "moved again, and stood there alone in the Bay of Eldamar; \n",
      "and it was called Tol Eressea, the Lonely Isle. There the \n",
      "Teleri abode as they wished under the stars of heaven, and \n",
      "yet within right of Aman and the deathless shore; and by \n",

      "the radiance of the Blessed Realm streamed forth, kindling \n",

      "been content with the fathering of his mighty son, the \n",

      "came to pass that Melkor, as the Valar had decreed, \n",
      "completed the term of his bondage, dwelling for three ages \n",
      "in the duress of Mandos, alone. At length, as Manwe had \n",

      "envy was in his heart; he looked upon the Children of \n",
      "lluvatar that sat at the feet of the Mighty, and hatred filled \n",
      "him; he looked upon the wealth of bright gems, and he \n",

      "not yet suffer him to depart beyond their sight and vigilance, \n",
      "and he was constrained to dwell within the gates of Valmar. \n",
      "But fair-seeming were all the words and deeds of Melkor in \n",

      "his aid and counsel, if they sought it; and therefore in a \n",
      "while he was given leave to go freely about the land, and it \n",
      "seemed to Manwe that the evil of Melkor was cured. For \n",
      "Manwe was free from evil and could not comprehend it, and \n",
      "he knew that in the beginning, in the thought of lluvatar, \n",
      "Melkor had been even as he; and he saw not to the depths \n",
      "of Melkorâ€™s heart, and did not perceive that all love had \n",
      "departed from him for ever. But Ulmo was not deceived, \n",
      "and Tulkas clenched his hands whenever he saw Melkor \n",

      "downfall. Therefore all the more did he feign love for them \n",

      "\n",
      "As three great Jewels they were in form. But not until \n",
      "the End, when Feanor shall return who perished ere the \n",
      "Sun was made, and sits now in the Halls of Awaiting and \n",
      "comes no more among his kin; not until the Sun passes \n",
      "and the Moon falls, shall it be known of what substance they \n",
      "were made. Like the crystal of diamonds it appeared, and \n",
      "yet was more strong than adamant, so that no violence \n",
      "could mar it or break it within the Kingdom of Arda. Yet that \n",
      "crystal was to the Silmarils but as is the body to the \n",
      "Children of lluvatar: the house of its inner fire, that is within it \n",
      "and yet in all parts of it, and is its life. And the inner fire of \n",
      "the Silmarils Feanor made of the blended light of the Trees \n",
      "of Valinor, which lives in them yet, though the Trees have \n",
      "long withered and shine no more. Therefore even in the \n",
      "darkness of the deepest treasury the Silmarils of their own \n",
      "radiance shone like the stars of Varda; and yet, as were \n",
      "they indeed living things, they rejoiced in light and received \n",
      "it and gave it back in hues more marvellous than before. \n",
      "\n",
      "All who dwelt in Aman were filled with wonder and \n",
      "delight at the work of Feanor. And Varda hallowed the \n",
      "Silmarils, so that thereafter no mortal flesh, nor hands \n",
      "unclean, nor anything of evil will might touch them, but it was \n",
      "scorched and withered; and Mandos foretold that the fates \n",
      "of Arda, earth, sea, and air, lay locked within them. The \n",
      "heart of Feanor was fast bound to these things that he \n",
      "himself had made. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Melkor lusted for the Silmarils, and the very \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "memory of their radiance was a gnawing fire in his heart. \n",
      "From that time forth, inflamed by this desire, he sought ever \n",
      "more eagerly how he should destroy Feanor and end the \n",
      "friendship of the Valar and the Elves; but he dissembled his \n",
      "purposes with cunning, and nothing of his malice could yet \n",
      "be seen in the semblance that he wore. Long was he at \n",
      "work, and slow at first and barren was his labour. But he \n",
      "that sows lies in the end shall not lack of a harvest, and \n",
      "soon he may rest from toil indeed while others reap and \n",
      "sow in his stead. Ever Melkor found some ears that would \n",
      "heed him, and some tongues that would enlarge what they \n",
      "had heard; and his lies passed from friend to friend, as \n",
      "secrets of which the knowledge proves the teller wise. \n",
      "Bitterly did the Noldor atone for the folly of their open ears \n",
      "in the days that followed after. \n",
      "\n",
      "When he saw that many leaned towards him, Melkor \n",
      "would often walk among them, and amid his fair words \n",
      "others were woven, so subtly that many who heard them \n",
      "believed in recollection that they arose from their own \n",
      "thought. Visions he would conjure in their hearts of the \n",
      "mighty realms that they could have ruled at their own will, in \n",
      "power and freedom in the East; and then whispers went \n",
      "abroad that the Valar had brought the Eldar to Aman \n",
      "because of their jealousy, fearing that the beauty of the \n",
      "Quendi and the makers' power that lluvatar had \n",
      "bequeathed to them would grow too great for the Valar to \n",
      "govern, as the Elves waxed and spread over the wide lands \n",
      "of the world. \n",
      "\n",
      "In those days, moreover, though the Valar knew indeed \n",
      "of the coming of Men that were to be, the Elves as yet knew \n",
      "naught of it; for Manwe had not revealed it to them. Bat \n",
      "Melkor spoke to them in secret of Mortal Men, seeing how \n",
      "the silence of the Valar might be twisted to evil. Little he \n",
      "knew yet concerning Men, for engrossed with his own \n",
      "thought in the Music he had paid small heed to the Third \n",
      "Theme of lluvatar; but now the whisper went among the \n",
      "Elves that Manwe held them captive, so that Men might \n",
      "come and supplant them in the kingdoms of Middle-earth, \n",
      "for the Valar saw that they might more easily sway this \n",
      "short-lived and weaker race, defrauding the Elves of the \n",
      "inheritance of lluvatar. Small truth was there in this, and little \n",
      "have the Valar ever prevailed to sway the wills of Men; but \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "many of the Noldor believed, or half believed, the evil \n",
      "words. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus ere the Valar were aware, the peace of Valinor \n",
      "was poisoned. The Noldor began to murmur against them, \n",
      "and many became filled with pride, forgetting how much of \n",
      "what they had and knew came to them in gift from the Valar. \n",
      "Fiercest burned the new flame of desire for freedom and \n",
      "wider realms in the eager heart of Feanor; and Melkor \n",
      "laughed in his secrecy, for to that mark his lies had been \n",
      "addressed, hating Feanor above all, and lusting ever for the \n",
      "Silmarils. But these he was not suffered to approach; for \n",
      "though at great feasts Feanor would wear them, blazing on \n",
      "his brow, at other times they were guarded close, locked in \n",
      "the deep chambers of his hoard in Tirion. For Feanor \n",
      "began to love the Silmarils with a greedy love, and grudged \n",
      "the sight of them to all save to his father and his seven \n",
      "sons; he seldom remembered now that the light within them \n",
      "was not his own. \n",
      "\n",
      "High princes were Feanor and Fingolfin, the elder \n",
      "sons of Finwe, honoured by all in Aman; but now they grew \n",
      "proud and jealous each of his rights and his possessions. \n",
      "Then Melkor set new lies abroad in Eldamar, and whispers \n",
      "came to Feanor that Fingolfin and his sons were plotting to \n",
      "usurp the leadership of Finwe and of the elder line of \n",
      "Feanor, and to supplant them by the leave of the Valar; for \n",
      "the Valar were ill-pleased that the Silmarils lay in Tirion and \n",
      "were not committed to their keeping. But to Fingolfin and \n",
      "Finarfin it was said: 'Beware! Small love has the proud son \n",
      "of Miriel ever had for the children of Indis. Now he has \n",
      "become great, and he has his father in his hand. It will not \n",
      "be long before he drives you forth from Tuna!' \n",
      "\n",
      "And when Melkor saw that these lies were \n",
      "smouldering, and that pride and anger were awake among \n",
      "the Noldor, he spoke to them concerning weapons; and in \n",
      "that time the Noldor began the smithying of swords and \n",
      "axes and spears. Shields also they made displaying the \n",
      "tokens of many houses and kindreds that vied one with \n",
      "another; and these only they wore abroad, and of other \n",
      "weapons they did not speak, for each believed that he \n",
      "alone had received the warning. And Feanor made a \n",
      "secret forge, of which not even Melkor was aware; and \n",
      "there he tempered fell swords for himself and for his sons, \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "and made tall helms with plumes of red. Bitterly did Mahtan \n",
      "rue the day when he taught to the husband of Nerdanel all \n",
      "the lore of metalwork that he had learned of Aule. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus with lies and evil whisperings and false counsel \n",
      "Melkor kindled the hearts of the Noldor to strife; and of their \n",
      "quarrels came at length the end of the high days of Valinor \n",
      "and the evening of its ancient glory. For Feanor now began \n",
      "openly to speak words of rebellion against the Valar, crying \n",
      "aloud that he would depart from Valinor back to the world \n",
      "without, and would deliver the Noldor from thraldom, if they \n",
      "would follow him. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then there was great unrest in Tirion, and Finwe was \n",
      "troubled; and he summoned all his lords to council. But \n",
      "Fingolfin hastened to his halls and stood before him, \n",
      "saying: 'King and father, wilt thou not restrain the pride of \n",
      "our brother, Curufinwe, who is called the Spirit of Fire, all \n",
      "too truly? By what right does he speak for all our people, as \n",
      "if he were King? Thou it was who long ago spoke before \n",
      "the Quendi, bidding them accept the summons of the Valar \n",
      "to Aman. Thou it was that led the Noldor upon the long road \n",
      "through the perils of Middle-earth to the light of Eldamar. If \n",
      "thou dost not now repent of it, two sons at least thou hast to \n",
      "honour thy words.' \n",
      "\n",
      "But even as Fingolfin spoke, Feanor strode into the \n",
      "chamber, and he was fully armed: his high helm upon his \n",
      "head, and at his side a mighty sword. 'So it is, even as I \n",
      "guessed,' he said. 'My half-brother would be before me with \n",
      "my father, in this as in all other matters.' Then turning upon \n",
      "Fingolfin he drew his sword, crying: 'Get thee gone, and \n",
      "take thy due place!' \n",
      "\n",
      "Fingolfin bowed before Finwe, and without word or \n",
      "glance to Feanor he went from the chamber. But Feanor \n",
      "followed him, and at the door of the king's house he stayed \n",
      "him; and the point of his bright sword he set against \n",
      "Fingolfin's breast 'See, half-brother!' he said. 'This is \n",
      "sharper than thy tongue. Try but once more to usurp my \n",
      "place and the love of my father, and maybe it will rid the \n",
      "Noldor of one who seeks to be the master of thralls.' \n",
      "\n",
      "These words were heard by many, for the house of \n",
      "Finwe was in the great square beneath the Mindon; but \n",
      "again Fingolfin made no answer, and passing through the \n",
      "throng in silence he went to seek Finarfin his brother. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the unrest of the Noldor was not indeed hidden \n",
      "from the Valar, but its seed had been sown in the dark; and \n",
      "therefore, since Feanor first spoke openly against them, \n",
      "they judged that he was the mover of discontent, being \n",
      "eminent in self-will and arrogance, though all the Noldor had \n",
      "become proud. And Manwe was grieved, but he watched \n",
      "and said no word. The Valar had brought the Eldar to their \n",
      "land freely, to dwell or to depart; and though they might \n",
      "judge departure to be folly, they might not restrain them \n",
      "from it. But now the deeds of Feanor could not be passed \n",
      "over, and the Valar were angered and dismayed; and he \n",
      "was summoned to appear before them at the gates of \n",
      "Valmar, to answer for all his words and deeds. There also \n",
      "were summoned all others who had any part in this matter, \n",
      "or any knowledge of it; and Feanor standing before \n",
      "Mandos in the Ring of Doom was commanded to answer \n",
      "all that was asked of him. Then at last the root was laid \n",
      "bare, and the malice of Melkor revealed; and straightway \n",
      "Tulkas left the council to lay hands upon him and bring him \n",
      "again to judgement. But Feanor was not held guiltless, for \n",
      "he it was that had broken the peace of Valinor and drawn \n",
      "his sword upon his kinsman; and Mandos said to him: \n",
      "Thou speakest of thraldom. If thraldom it be, thou canst not \n",
      "escape it; for Manwe is King of Arda, and not of Aman only. \n",
      "And this deed was unlawful, whether in Aman or not in \n",
      "Aman. Therefore this doom is now made: for twelve years \n",
      "thou shall leave Tirion where this threat was uttered. In that \n",
      "time take counsel with thyself, and remember who and what \n",
      "thou art. But after that time this matter shall be set in peace \n",
      "and held redressed, if others will release thee.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Fingolfin said: 'I will release my brother.' But \n",
      "Feanor spoke no word in answer, standing silent before the \n",
      "Valar. Then he turned and left the council, and departed \n",
      "from Valmar. \n",
      "\n",
      "With him into banishment went his seven sons, and \n",
      "northward in Valinor they made a strong place and treasury \n",
      "in the hills; and there at Formenos a multitude of gems \n",
      "were laid in hoard, and weapons also, and the Silmarils \n",
      "were shut in a chamber of iron. Thither also came Finwe \n",
      "the King, because of the love that he bore to Feanor; and \n",
      "Fingolfin ruled the Noldor in Tirion. Thus the lies of Melkor \n",
      "were made true in seeming, though Feanor by his own \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "deeds had brought this thing to pass; and the bitterness \n",
      "that Melkor had sown endured, and lived still long \n",
      "afterwards between the sons of Fingolfin and Feanor. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now Melkor, knowing that his devices had been \n",
      "revealed, hid himself and passed from place to place as a \n",
      "cloud in the hills; and Tulkas sought for him in vain. Then it \n",
      "seemed to the people of Valinor that the light of the Trees \n",
      "was dimmed, and the shadows of all standing things grew \n",
      "longer and darker in that time. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is told that for a time Melkor was not seen again in \n",
      "Valinor, nor was any rumour heard of him, until suddenly he \n",
      "came to Formenos, and spoke with Feanor before his \n",
      "doors. Friendship he feigned with cunning argument, urging \n",
      "him to his former thought of flight from the trammels of the \n",
      "Valar; and he said: 'Behold the truth of all that I have \n",
      "spoken, and how thou art banished unjustly. But if the heart \n",
      "of Feanor is yet free and bold as were his words in Tlrion, \n",
      "then I will aid him, and bring him far from this narrow land. \n",
      "For am I not Vala also? Yea, and more than those who sit in \n",
      "pride in Valimar; and I have ever been a friend to the \n",
      "Noldor, most skilled and most valiant of the people of Arda.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Now Feanor's heart was still bitter at his humiliation \n",
      "before Mandos, and he looked at Melkor in silence, \n",
      "pondering if indeed he might yet trust him so far as to aid \n",
      "him in his flight. And Melkor, seeing that Feanor wavered, \n",
      "and knowing that the Silmarils held his heart in thrall, said at \n",
      "the last: 'Here is a strong place, and well guarded; but think \n",
      "not that the Silmarils will lie safe in any treasury within the \n",
      "realm of the Valar!' \n",
      "\n",
      "But his cunning overreached his aim; his words \n",
      "touched too deep, and awoke a fire more fierce than he \n",
      "designed; and Feanor looked upon Melkor with eyes that \n",
      "burned through his fair semblance and pierced the cloaks \n",
      "of his mind, perceiving there his fierce lust for the Silmarils. \n",
      "Then hate overcame Feanor's fear, and he cursed Melkor \n",
      "and bade him be gone, saying: 'Get thee gone from my \n",
      "gate, thou jail-crow of Mandos!' And he shut the doors of \n",
      "his house in the face of the mightiest of all the dwellers in \n",
      "Ea. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Melkor departed in shame, for he was himself in \n",
      "peril, and he saw not his time yet for revenge; but his heart \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "was black with anger. And Finwe was filled with great fear, \n",
      "and in haste he sent messengers to Manwe in Valmar. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now the Valar were sitting in council before their \n",
      "gates, fearing the lengthening of the shadows, when the \n",
      "messengers came from Formenos. At once Orome and \n",
      "Tulkas sprang up, but even as they set out in pursuit \n",
      "messengers came from Eldamar, telling that Melkor had \n",
      "fled through the Calacirya, and from the hill of Tuna the \n",
      "Elves had seen him pass in wrath as a thundercloud. And \n",
      "they said that thence he had turned northward, for the Teleri \n",
      "in Alqualonde had seen his shadow going by their haven \n",
      "towards Araman. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus Melkor departed from Valinor, and for a while the \n",
      "Two Trees shone again unshadowed, and the land was \n",
      "filled with light. But the Valar sought in vain for tidings of \n",
      "their enemy; and as a cloud far off that looms ever higher, \n",
      "borne upon a slow cold wind, a doubt now marred the joy of \n",
      "all the dwellers in Aman, dreading they knew not what evil \n",
      "that yet might come. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "When Manwe heard of the ways that Melkor had taken, \n",
      "it seemed plain to him that he purposed to escape to his \n",
      "old strongholds in the north of Middle-earth; and Orome and \n",
      "Tulkas went with all speed northward, seeking to overtake \n",
      "him if they might, but they found no trace or rumour of him \n",
      "beyond the shores of the Teleri, in the unpeopled wastes \n",
      "that drew near to the Ice. Thereafter the watch was \n",
      "redoubled along the northern fences of Aman; but to no \n",
      "purpose, for ere ever the pursuit set out Melkor had turned \n",
      "back, and in secrecy passed away far to the south. For he \n",
      "was yet as one of the Valar, and could change his form, or \n",
      "walk unclad, as could his brethren; though that power he \n",
      "was soon to lose for ever. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus unseen he came at last to the dark region of \n",
      "Avathar. That narrow land lay south of the Bay of Eldamar, \n",
      "beneath the eastern feet of the Pelori, and its long and \n",
      "mournful shores stretched away into the south, lightless and \n",
      "unexplored. There, beneath the sheer walls of the \n",
      "mountains and the cold dark sea, the shadows were \n",
      "deepest and thickest in the world; and there in Avathar, \n",
      "secret and unknown, Ungoliant had made her abode. The \n",
      "Eldar knew not whence she came; but some have said that \n",
      "in ages long before she descended from the darkness that \n",
      "lies about Arda, when Melkor first looked down in envy \n",
      "upon the Kingdom of Manwe, and that in the beginning she \n",
      "was one of those that he corrupted to his service. But she \n",
      "had disowned her Master, desiring to be mistress of her \n",
      "own lust, taking all things to herself to feed her emptiness; \n",
      "and she fled to the south, escaping the assaults of the Valar \n",
      "and the hunters of Orome, for their vigilance had ever been \n",
      "to the north, and the south was long unheeded. Thence she \n",
      "had crept towards the light of the Blessed Realm; for she \n",
      "hungered for light and hated it. \n",
      "\n",
      "In a ravine she lived, and took shape as a spider of \n",
      "monstrous form, weaving her black webs in a cleft of the \n",
      "mountains. There she sucked up all light that she could find, \n",
      "and spun it forth again in dark nets of strangling gloom, until \n",
      "no light more could come to her abode; and she was \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "famished. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now Melkor came to Avathar and sought her out; and \n",
      "he put on again the form that he had worn as the tyrant of \n",
      "Utumno: a dark Lord, tall and terrible. In that form he \n",
      "remained ever after. There in the black shadows, beyond \n",
      "the sight even of Manwe in his highest halls, Melkor with \n",
      "Ungoliant plotted his revenge. But when Ungoliant \n",
      "understood the purpose of Melkor, she was torn between \n",
      "lust and great fear; for she was loath to dare the perils of \n",
      "Aman and the power of the dreadful Lords, and she would \n",
      "not stir from her hiding. Therefore Melkor said to her: 'Do \n",
      "as I bid; and if thou hunger still when all is done, then I will \n",
      "give thee whatsoever thy lust may demand. Yea, with both \n",
      "hands.' Lightly he made this vow, as he ever did; and he \n",
      "laughed in his heart. Thus did the great thief set his lure for \n",
      "the lesser. \n",
      "\n",
      "A cloak of darkness she wove about them when \n",
      "Melkor and Ungoliant set forth; an Unlight, in which things \n",
      "seemed to be no more, and which eyes could not pierce, \n",
      "for it was void. Then slowly she wrought her webs: rope by \n",
      "rope from cleft to cleft, from jutting rock to pinnacle of stone, \n",
      "ever climbing upwards, crawling and clinging, until at last \n",
      "she reached the very summit of Hyarmentir, the highest \n",
      "mountain in that region of the world, far south of great \n",
      "Taniquetil. There the Valar were not vigilant; for west of the \n",
      "Pelori was an empty land in twilight, and eastward the \n",
      "mountains looked out, save for forgotten Avathar, only upon \n",
      "the dim waters of the pathless sea. But now upon the \n",
      "mountain-top dark Ungoliant lay; and she made a ladder of \n",
      "woven ropes and cast it down, and Melkor climbed upon it \n",
      "and came to that high place, and stood beside her, looking \n",
      "down upon the Guarded Realm. Below them lay the woods \n",
      "of Orome, and westward shimmered the fields and \n",
      "pastures of Yavanna, gold beneath the tall wheat of the \n",
      "gods. Bat Melkor looked north, and saw afar the shining \n",
      "plain, and the silver domes of Valmar gleaming in the \n",
      "mingling of the lights of Telperion and Laurelin. Then Melkor \n",
      "laughed aloud, and leapt swiftly down the long western \n",
      "slopes; and Ungoliant was at his side, and her darkness \n",
      "covered them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now it was a time of festival, as Melkor knew well. \n",
      "Though all tides and seasons were at the will of the Valar, \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "and in Valinor there was no winter of death, nonetheless \n",
      "they dwelt then in the Kingdom of Arda, and that was but a \n",
      "small realm in the halls of Ea, whose life is Time, which \n",
      "flows ever from the first note to the last chord of Eru. And \n",
      "even as it was then the delight of the Valar (as is told in the \n",
      "Ainulindale) to clothe themselves as in a vesture in the \n",
      "forms of the Children of lluvatar, so also did they eat and \n",
      "drink, and gather the fruits of Yavanna from the Earth, which \n",
      "under Eru they had made. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore Yavanna set times for the flowering and the \n",
      "ripening of all things mat grew in Valinor; and at each first \n",
      "gathering of fruits Manwe made a high feast for the praising \n",
      "of Eru, when all the peoples of Valinor poured forth their joy \n",
      "in music and song upon Taniquetil. This now was the hour, \n",
      "and Manwe decreed a feast more glorious than any that \n",
      "had been held since the coming of the Eldar to Aman. For \n",
      "though the escape of Melkor portended toils and sorrows to \n",
      "come, and indeed none could tell what further hurts would \n",
      "be done to Arda ere he could be subdued again, at this \n",
      "time Manwe designed to heal the evil that had arisen \n",
      "among the Noldor; and all were bidden to come to his halls \n",
      "upon Taniquetil, there to put aside the griefs that lay \n",
      "between their princes, and forget utterly the lies of their \n",
      "Enemy. There came the Vanyar, and there came the Noldor \n",
      "of Tirion, and the Maiar were gathered together, and the \n",
      "Valar were arrayed in their beauty and majesty; and they \n",
      "sang before Manwe and Varda in their lofty halls, or danced \n",
      "upon the green slopes of the Mountain that looked west \n",
      "towards the Trees. In that day the streets of Valmar were \n",
      "empty, and the stairs of Tirion were silent; and all the land \n",
      "lay sleeping in peace. Only the Teleri beyond the mountains \n",
      "still sang upon the shores of the sea; for they recked little of \n",
      "seasons or times, and gave no thought to the cares of the \n",
      "Rulers of Arda, or the shadow that had fallen on Valinor, for \n",
      "it had not touched them, as yet. \n",
      "\n",
      "One thing only marred the design of Manwe. Feanor \n",
      "came indeed, for him alone Manwe had commanded to \n",
      "come; but Finwe came not, nor any others of the Noldor of \n",
      "Formenos. For said Finwe; 'While the ban lasts upon \n",
      "Feanor my son, that he may not go to Tirion, I hold myself \n",
      "unkinged, and I will not meet my people.' And Feanor came \n",
      "not in raiment of festival, and he wore no ornament, neither \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "silver nor gold nor any gem; and he denied the sight of the \n",
      "Silmarils to the Valar and the Eldar, and left them locked in \n",
      "Formenos in their chamber of iron. Nevertheless he met \n",
      "Fingolfin before the throne of Manwe, and was reconciled, \n",
      "in word; and Fingolfin set at naught the unsheathing of the \n",
      "sword. For Fingolfin held forth his hand, saying: 'As I \n",
      "promised, I do now. I release thee, and remember no \n",
      "grievance.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Feanor took his hand in silence; but Fingolfin \n",
      "said: 'Half-brother in blood, full brother in heart will I be. \n",
      "Thou shalt lead and I will follow. May no new grief divide as.' \n",
      "\n",
      "'I hear thee,' said Feanor. 'So be it.' But they did not \n",
      "know the meaning that their words would bear. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is told that even as Feanor and Fingolfin stood \n",
      "before Manwe there came the mingling of the lights, when \n",
      "both Trees were shining, and the silent city of Valmar was \n",
      "filled with a radiance of silver and gold. And in that very \n",
      "hour Melkor and Ungoliant came hastening over the fields \n",
      "of Valinor, as the shadow of a black cloud upon the wind \n",
      "fleets over the sunlit earth; and they came before the green \n",
      "mound Ezellohar. Then the Unlight of Ungoliant rose up \n",
      "even to the roots of the Trees, and Melkor sprang upon the \n",
      "mound; and with his black spear he smote each Tree to its \n",
      "core, wounded them deep, and their sap poured forth as it \n",
      "were their blood, and was spilled upon the ground. But \n",
      "Ungoliant sucked it up, and going then from Tree to Tree \n",
      "she set her black beak to their wounds, till they were \n",
      "drained; and the poison of Death that was in her went into \n",
      "their tissues and withered them, root, branch, and leaf; and \n",
      "they died. And still she thirsted, and going to the Wells of \n",
      "Varda she drank them dry; but Ungoliant belched forth \n",
      "black vapours as she drank, and swelled to a shape so \n",
      "vast and hideous that Melkor was afraid. \n",
      "\n",
      "So the great darkness fell upon Valinor. Of the deeds \n",
      "of that day much is told in the Aldudenie, that Elemmire of \n",
      "the Vanyar made and is known to all the Eldar. Yet no song \n",
      "or tale could contain all the grief and terror that then befell. \n",
      "The Light failed; but the Darkness that followed was more \n",
      "than loss of light. In that hour was made a Darkness that \n",
      "seemed not lack but a thing with being of its own: for it was \n",
      "indeed made by malice out of Light, and it had power to \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "pierce the eye, and to enter heart and mind, and strangle \n",
      "the very will. \n",
      "\n",
      "Varda looked down from Taniquetil, and beheld the \n",
      "Shadow soaring up in sudden towers of gloom; Valmar had \n",
      "foundered in a deep sea of night. Soon the Holy Mountain \n",
      "stood alone, a last island in a world that was drowned. All \n",
      "song ceased. There was silence in Valinor, and no sound \n",
      "could be heard, save only from afar there came on the wind \n",
      "through the pass of the mountains the wailing of the Teleri \n",
      "like the cold cry of gulls. For it blew chill from the East in \n",
      "that hour, and the vast shadows of the sea were rolled \n",
      "against the walls of the shore. \n",
      "\n",
      "But Manwe from his high seat looked out, and his eyes \n",
      "alone pierced through the night, until they saw a Darkness \n",
      "beyond dark which they could not penetrate, huge but far \n",
      "away, moving now northward with great speed; and he \n",
      "knew that Melkor had come and gone. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the pursuit was begun; and the earth shook \n",
      "beneath the horses of the host of Orome, and the fire that \n",
      "was stricken from the hooves of Nahar was the first light \n",
      "that returned to Valinor. But so soon as any came up with \n",
      "the Cloud of Ungoliant the riders of the Valar were blinded \n",
      "and dismayed, and they were scattered, and went they \n",
      "knew not whither; and the sound of the Valaroma faltered \n",
      "and failed. And Tulkas was as one caught in a black net at \n",
      "night, and he stood powerless and beat the air in vain. But \n",
      "when the Darkness had passed, it was too late: Melkor had \n",
      "gone whither he would, and his vengeance was achieved. \n",

      "Chapter 9 \n",
      "\n",
      "Of the Flight of the Noldor \n",
      "\n",
      "After a time a great concourse gathered about the \n",
      "Ring of Doom; and the Valar sat in shadow, for it was night. \n",
      "But the stars of Varda now glimmered overhead, and the \n",
      "air was clear; for the winds of Manwe has driven away the \n",
      "vapours of death and rolled back the shadows of the sea. \n",
      "Then Yavanna arose and stood upon Ezellohar, the Green \n",
      "Mound, but it was bare now and black; and she laid her \n",
      "hands upon the Trees, but they were dead and dark, and \n",
      "each branch that she touched broke and fell lifeless at her \n",
      "feet. Then many voices were lifted in lamentation; and it \n",
      "seemed to those that mourned that they had drained to the \n",
      "dregs the cup of woe that Melkor had filled for them. But it \n",
      "was not so. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yavanna spoke before the Valar, saying: \"The Light of \n",
      "the Trees has passed away, and lives now only in the \n",
      "Silmarils of Feanor. Foresighted was he! Even for those \n",
      "who are mightiest under lluvatar there is some work that \n",
      "they may accomplish once, and once only. The Light of the \n",
      "Trees I brought into being, and within Ea I can do so never \n",
      "again. Yet had I but a little of that light I could recall life to the \n",
      "Trees, ere their roots decay; and then our hurt should be \n",
      "healed, and the malice of Melkor be confounded.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Manwe spoke and said: 'Hearest thou, Feanor \n",
      "son of Finwe, the words of Yavanna? Wilt thou grant what \n",
      "she would ask?' \n",
      "\n",
      "There was long silence, but Feanor answered no word. \n",
      "Then Tulkas cried: 'Speak, O Noldo, yea or nay! But who \n",
      "shall deny Yavanna? And did not the light of the Silmarils \n",
      "come from her work in the beginning?' \n",
      "\n",
      "But Aule the Maker said: 'Be not hasty! We ask a \n",
      "greater thing than thou knowest. Let him have peace yet \n",
      "awhile.' \n",
      "\n",
      "But Feanor spoke then, and cried bitterly: 'For the less \n",
      "even as for the greater there is some deed that he may \n",
      "accomplish but once only; and in that deed his heart shall \n",
      "rest. It may be that I can unlock my jewels, but never again \n",
      "shall I make their like; and if I must break them, I shall break \n",
      "my heart, and I shall be slain; first of all the Eldar in Aman.' \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "'Not the first,' said Mandos, but they did not understand \n",
      "his word; and again there was silence, while Feanor \n",
      "brooded in the dark. It seemed to him that he was beset in \n",
      "a ring of enemies, and the words of Melkor returned to him, \n",
      "saying that the Silmarils were not safe, if the Valar would \n",
      "possess them. 'And is he not Vala as are they,' said his \n",
      "thought, 'and does he not understand their hearts? Yea, a \n",
      "thief shall reveal thieves!' Then he cried aloud: 'This thing I \n",
      "will not do of free will. But if the Valar will constrain me, then \n",
      "shall I know indeed that Melkor is of their kindred.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Mandos said: 'Thou hast spoken.' And Nienna \n",
      "arose and went up onto Ezellohar, and cast back her grey \n",
      "hood, and with her tears washed away the defilements of \n",
      "Ungoliant; and she sang in mourning for the bitterness of \n",
      "the world and the Marring of Arda. \n",
      "\n",
      "But even as Nienna mourned, there came messengers \n",
      "from Formenos, and they were Noldorand bore new tidings \n",
      "of evil. For they told how a blind Darkness came northward, \n",
      "and in the midst walked some power for which there was \n",
      "no name, and the Darkness issued from it. But Melkor also \n",
      "was there, and he came to the house of Feanor, and there \n",
      "he slew Finwe King of the Noldor before his doors, and \n",
      "spilled the first blood in the Blessed Realm; for Finwe alone \n",
      "had not fled from the horror of the Dark. And they told that \n",
      "Melkor had broken the stronghold of Formenos, and taken \n",
      "all the Jewels of the Noldor that were hoarded in that place; \n",
      "and the Silmarils were gone. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Feanor rose, and lifting up his hand before \n",
      "Manwe he cursed Melkor, naming him Morgoth, the Black \n",
      "Foe of the World; and by that name only was he known to \n",
      "the Eldar ever after. And he cursed also the summons of \n",
      "Manwe and the hour in which he came to Taniquetil, \n",
      "thinking in the madness of his rage and grief that had he \n",
      "been at Formenos his strength would have availed more \n",
      "than to be slain also, as Melkor had purposed. Then \n",
      "Feanor ran from the Ring of Doom, and fled into the night; \n",
      "for his father was dearer to him than the Light of Valinor or \n",
      "the peerless works of his hands; and who among sons, of \n",
      "Elves or of Men, have held their fathers of greater worth? \n",
      "\n",
      "Many there grieved for the anguish of Feanor, but his \n",
      "loss was not his alone; and Yavanna wept by the mound, in \n",
      "fear that the Darkness should swallow the last rays of the \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Light of Valinor for ever. For though the Valar did not yet \n",
      "understand fully what had befallen, they perceived that \n",
      "Melkor had called upon some aid that came from beyond \n",
      "Arda. The Silmarils had passed away, and all one it may \n",
      "seem whether Feanor had said yea or nay to Yavanna; yet \n",
      "had he said yea at the first, before the tidings came from \n",
      "Formenos, it may be that his after deeds would have been \n",
      "other than they were. But now the doom of the Noldor drew \n",
      "near. \n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile Morgoth escaping from the pursuit of the \n",
      "Valar came to the wastes of Araman. This land lay \n",
      "northward between the Mountains of the Pelori and the \n",
      "Great Sea, as Avathar lay to the south; but Araman was a \n",
      "wider land, and between the shores and the mountains \n",
      "were barren plains, ever colder as the Ice drew nearer. \n",
      "Through this region Morgoth and Ungoliant passed in \n",
      "haste, and so came through the great mists of Oiomure to \n",
      "the Helcaraxe, where the strait between Araman and \n",
      "Middle-earth was filled with grinding ice; and he crossed \n",
      "over, and came back at last to the north of the Outer Lands. \n",
      "Together they went on, for Morgoth could not elude \n",
      "Ungoliant, and her cloud was still about him, and all her \n",
      "eyes were upon him; and they came to those lands that lay \n",
      "north of the Firth of Drengist. Now Morgoth was drawing \n",
      "near to the ruins of Angband, where his great western \n",
      "stronghold had been; and Ungoliant perceived his hope, \n",
      "and knew that here he would seek to escape from her, and \n",
      "she stayed him, demanding that he fulfil his promise. \n",
      "\n",
      "'Blackhead!' she said. 'I have done thy bidding. But I \n",
      "hunger still.' \n",
      "\n",
      "'What wouldst thou have more?' said Morgoth. 'Dost \n",
      "thou desire all the world for thy belly? I did not vow to give \n",
      "thee that. I am its Lord.' \n",
      "\n",
      "'Not so much,' said Ungoliant. 'But thou hast a great \n",
      "treasure from Formenos; I will have all that. Yea, with both \n",
      "hands thou shalt give it'. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then perforce Morgoth surrendered to her the gems \n",
      "that he bore with him, one by one and grudgingly; and she \n",
      "devoured them, and their beauty perished from the world. \n",
      "Huger and darker yet grew Ungoliant, but her lust was \n",
      "unsated. 'With one hand thou givest,' she said; 'with the left \n",
      "only. Open thy right hand.' \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In his right hand Morgoth held close the Silmarils, and \n",
      "though they were locked in a crystal casket, they had begun \n",
      "to bum him, and his hand was clenched in pain; but he \n",
      "would not open it 'Nay!' he said. Thou hast had thy doe. For \n",
      "with my power that I put into thee thy work was \n",
      "accomplished. I need thee no more. These things thou shalt \n",
      "not have, nor see. I name them unto myself for ever. ' \n",
      "\n",
      "But Ungoliant had grown great, and he less by the \n",
      "power that had gone out of him; and she rose against him, \n",
      "and her cloud closed about him, and she enmeshed him in \n",
      "a web of clinging thongs to strangle him. Then Morgoth sent \n",
      "forth a terrible cry, that echoed in the mountains. Therefore \n",
      "that region was called Lammoth; for the echoes of his voice \n",
      "dwelt there ever after, so that any who cried aloud in that \n",
      "land awoke them, and all the waste between the hills and \n",
      "the sea was filled with a clamour as of voices in anguish. \n",
      "The cry of Morgoth in that hour was the greatest and most \n",
      "dreadful that was ever heard in the northern world; the \n",
      "mountains shook, and the earth trembled, and rocks were \n",
      "riven asunder. Deep in forgotten places that cry was heard. \n",
      "Far beneath the ruined halls of Angband, in vaults to which \n",
      "the Valar in the haste of their assault had not descended, \n",
      "Balrogs lurked still, awaiting ever the return of their Lord; \n",
      "and now swiftly they arose, and passing over Hithlum they \n",
      "came to Lammoth as a tempest of fire. With their whips of \n",
      "flame they smote asunder the webs of Ungoliant, and she \n",
      "quailed, and turned to flight, belching black vapours to \n",
      "cover her; and fleeing from the north she went down into \n",
      "Beleriand, and dwelt beneath Ered Gorgoroth, in that dark \n",
      "valley that was after called Nan Dungortheb, the Valley of \n",
      "Dreadful Death, because of the horror that she bred there. \n",
      "For other foul creatures of spider form had dwelt there \n",
      "since the days of the delving of Angband, and she mated \n",
      "with them, and devoured them; and even after Ungoliant \n",
      "herself departed, and went whither she would into the \n",
      "forgotten south of the world, her offspring abode there and \n",
      "wove their hideous webs. Of the fate of Ungoliant no tale \n",
      "tells. Yet some have said that she ended long ago, when in \n",
      "her uttermost famine she devoured herself at last. \n",
      "\n",
      "And thus the fear of Yavanna that the Silmarils would \n",
      "be swallowed up and fall into nothingness did not come to \n",
      "pass; but they remained in the power of Morgoth. And he \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "being freed gathered again all his servants that he could \n",
      "find, and came to the ruins of Angband. There he delved \n",
      "anew his vast vaults and dungeons, and above their gates \n",
      "he reared the threefold peaks of Thangorodrim, and a great \n",
      "reek of dark smoke was ever wreathed about them. There \n",
      "countless became the hosts of his beasts and his demons, \n",
      "and the race of the Ores, bred long before, grew and \n",
      "multiplied in the bowels of the earth. Dark now fell the \n",
      "shadow on Beleriand, as is told hereafter, but in Angband \n",
      "Morgoth forged for himself a great crown of iron, and he \n",
      "called himself King of the World. In token of this he set the \n",
      "Silmarils in his crown. His hands were burned black by the \n",
      "touch of those hallowed jewels, and black they remained \n",
      "ever after; nor was he ever free from the pain of the burning, \n",
      "and the anger of the pain. That crown he never took from \n",
      "his head, though its weight became a deadly weariness. \n",
      "Never but once only did he depart for a while secretly from \n",
      "his domain in the North; seldom indeed did he leave the \n",
      "deep places of his fortress, but governed his armies from \n",
      "his northern throne. And once only also did he himself wield \n",
      "weapon, while his realm lasted. \n",
      "\n",

      "was humbled, his hatred devoured him, and in the \n",
      "domination of his servants and the inspiring of them with \n",
      "lust of evil he spent his spirit. Nonetheless his majesty as \n",
      "one of the Valar long remained, though turned to terror, and \n",

      "Now when it was known that Morgoth had escaped \n",

      "remained long seated in darkness in the Ring of Doom, \n",
      "and the Maiar and the Vanyar stood beside them and wept; \n",
      "but the Noldor for the most part returned to Tlrion and \n",
      "mourned for the darkening of their fair city. Through the dim \n",

      "what he would say; and the hill and an the stairs and streets \n",
      "that climbed upon it were lit with the light of many torches \n",
      "that each one bore in hand. Feanor was a master of words, \n",

      "the Noldor were stirred to madness. His wrath and his hate \n",
      "were given most to Morgoth, and yet well nigh all that he \n",
      "said came from the very lies of Morgoth himself; but he was \n",
      "distraught with grief for the slaying of his father, and with \n",
      "anguish for the rape of the Silmarils. He claimed now the \n",
      "kingship of all the Noldor, since Finwe was dead, and he \n",

      "he be now their foe, are not they and he of one kin? \n",
      "Vengeance calls me hence, but even were it otherwise I \n",

      "calling the Everlasting Dark upon them if they kept it not; \n",

      "sworn, good or evil, an oath may not be broken, and it shall \n",
      "pursue oathkeeper and oathbreaker to the world's end. \n",
      "Fingolfin and Turgon his son therefore spoke against \n",
      "Feanor, and fierce words awoke, so that once again wrath \n",
      "came near to the edge of swords. But Finarfin spoke softly, \n",
      "as was his wont, and sought to calm the Noldor, persuading \n",
      "them to pause and ponder ere deeds were done that could \n",
      "not be undone; and Orodreth, alone of his sons, spoke in \n",
      "like manner. Finrod was with Turgon, his friend; but \n",
      "Galadriel, the only woman of the Noldor to stand that day \n",
      "tall and valiant among the contending princes, was eager to \n",
      "be gone. No oaths she swore, but the words of Feanor \n",
      "concerning Middle-earth had kindled in her heart, for she \n",
      "yearned to see the wide unguarded lands and to rule there \n",
      "a realm at her own will. Of like mind with Galadriel was \n",
      "Fingon Fingolfin's son, being moved also by Feanorâ€™s \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "they ever did Angrod and Aegnor, sons of Finarfin. But \n",

      "\n",
      "At length after long debate Feanor prevailed, and the \n",
      "greater part of the Noldor there assembled he set aflame \n",
      "with the desire of new things and strange countries. \n",
      "Therefore when Finarfin spoke yet again for heed and \n",
      "delay, a great shout went up: 'Nay, let us be gone!' And \n",

      "marching forth. \n",
      "\n",
      "Little foresight could there be for those who dared to \n",
      "take so dark a road. Yet all was done in over-haste; for \n",
      "Feanor drove them on, fearing lest in the cooling of their \n",
      "hearts his words should wane and other counsels yet \n",
      "prevail; and for all his proud words he did not forget the \n",
      "power of the Valar. But from Valmar no message came, \n",
      "and Manwe was silent. He would not yet either forbid or \n",
      "hinder Feanoris purpose; for the Valar were aggrieved that \n",
      "they were charged with evil intent to the Eldar, or that any \n",
      "were held captive by them against their will. Now they \n",
      "watched and waited, for they did not yet believe that Feanor \n",
      "could hold the host of the Noldor to his will. \n",
      "\n",
      "And indeed when Feanor began the marshalling of the \n",
      "Noldor for their setting-out, then at once dissension arose. \n",
      "For though he had brought the assembly in a mind to \n",
      "depart, by no means all were of a mind to take Feanor as \n",
      "King. Greater love was given to Fingolfin and his sons, and \n",
      "his household and the most part of the dwellers in Tlrion \n",
      "refused to renounce him, if he would go with them; and thus \n",
      "at the last as two divided hosts the Noldor set forth upon \n",
      "their bitter road. Feanor and his following were in the van, \n",
      "but the greater host came behind under Fingolfin; and he \n",
      "marched against his wisdom, because Fingon his son so \n",
      "urged him, and because he would not be sundered from his \n",
      "people that were eager to go, nor leave them to the rash \n",
      "counsels of Feanor. Nor did he forget his words before the \n",
      "throne of Manwe. With Fingolfin went Finarfin also and for \n",
      "like reasons; but most loath was he to depart. And of all the \n",
      "Noldor in Valinor, who were grown now to a great people, \n",
      "but one tithe refused to take the road: some for the love that \n",
      "they bore to the Valar (and to Aule not least), some for the \n",
      "love of Tlrion and the many things that they had made; none \n",
      "for fear of peril by the way. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But even as the trumpet sang and Feanor issued from \n",
      "the gates of Tlrion a messenger came at last from Manwe, \n",
      "saying: 'Against the folly of Feanor shall be set my counsel \n",
      "only. Go not forth! For the hour is evil, and your road leads \n",
      "to sorrow that ye do not foresee. No aid will the Valar lend \n",
      "you in this quest; but neither will they hinder you; for this ye \n",
      "shall know: as ye came hither freely, freely shall ye depart. \n",
      "But thou Feanor Finwe's son, by thine oath art exiled. The \n",
      "lies of Melkor thou shalt unlearn in bitterness. Vala he is, \n",
      "thou saist Then thou hast sworn in vain, for none of the \n",
      "Valar canst thou overcome now or ever within the halls of \n",
      "Ea, not though Eru whom thou namest had made thee \n",
      "thrice greater than thou art.' \n",
      "\n",
      "But Feanor laughed, and spoke not to the herald, but \n",
      "to the Noldor, saying: 'So! Then will this valiant people send \n",
      "forth the heir of their King alone into banishment with his \n",
      "sons only, and return to their bondage? But if any will come \n",
      "with me, I say to them: Is sorrow foreboded to you? But in \n",
      "Aman we have seen it. In Aman we have come through \n",
      "bliss to woe. The other now we will try: through sorrow to \n",
      "find joy; or freedom, at the least.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then turning to the herald he cried: 'Say this to Manwe \n",
      "Sulimo, High King of Arda: if Feanor cannot overthrow \n",
      "Morgoth, at least he delays not to assail him, and sits not \n",
      "idle in grief. And it may be that Eru has set in me a fire \n",
      "greater than thou knowest. Such hurt at the least will I do to \n",
      "the Foe of the Valar that even the mighty in the Ring of \n",
      "Doom shall wonder to hear it. Yea, in the end they shall \n",
      "follow me. Farewell!' \n",
      "\n",
      "In that hour the voice of Feanor grew so great and so \n",
      "potent that even the herald of the Valar bowed before him \n",
      "as one full-answered, and departed; and the Noldor were \n",
      "over-ruled. Therefore they continued their march; and the \n",
      "House of Feanor hastened before them along the coasts of \n",
      "Elende: not once did they turn their eyes back to Tlrion on \n",
      "the green hill of Tuna. Slower and less eagerly came the \n",
      "host of Fingolfin after them. Of those Fingon was the \n",
      "foremost; but at the rear went Finarfin and Finrod, and \n",
      "many of the noblest and wisest of the Noldor; and often they \n",
      "looked behind them to see their fair city, until the lamp of \n",
      "the Mindon Eldalieva was lost in the night. More than any \n",
      "others of the Exiles they carried thence memories of the \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "bliss they had forsaken, and some even of the things that \n",
      "they had made there they took with them: a solace and a \n",
      "burden on the road. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now Feanor led the Noldor northward, because his \n",
      "first purpose was to follow Morgoth. Moreover Tuna \n",
      "beneath Taniquetil was set nigh to the girdle of Arda, and \n",
      "there the Great Sea was immeasurably wide, whereas ever \n",
      "northward the sundering seas grew narrower, as the \n",
      "wasteland of Araman and the coasts of Middle-earth drew \n",
      "together. But as the mind of Feanor cooled and took \n",
      "counsel he perceived overlate that all these great \n",
      "companies would never overcome the long leagues to the \n",
      "north, nor cross the seas at the last, save with the aid of \n",
      "ships; yet it would need long time and toil to build so great \n",
      "a fleet, even were there any among the Noldor skilled in that \n",
      "craft. He resolved now therefore to persuade the Teleri, \n",
      "ever friends to the Noldor, to join with them; and in his \n",
      "rebellion he thought that thus the bliss of Valinor might be \n",
      "further diminished and his power for war upon Morgoth be \n",
      "increased. He hastened then to Alqualonde, and spoke to \n",
      "the Teleri as he had spoken before in Tirion. \n",
      "\n",
      "But the Teleri were unmoved by aught that he could \n",
      "say. They were grieved indeed at the going of their kinsfolk \n",
      "and long friends, but would rather dissuade them than aid \n",
      "them; and no ship would they lend, nor help in the building, \n",
      "against the will of the Valar. As for themselves, they desired \n",
      "now no other home but the strands of Eldamar, and no \n",
      "other lord than Olwe, prince of Alqualonde. And he had \n",
      "never lent ear to Morgoth, nor welcomed him to his land, \n",
      "and he trusted still that Ulmo and the other great among the \n",
      "Valar would redress the hurts of Morgoth, and that the night \n",
      "would pass yet to a new dawn. Then Feanor grew wrathful, \n",
      "for he still feared delay; and hotly he spoke to Olwe. 'You \n",
      "renounce your friendship, even in the hour of our need,' he \n",
      "said. 'Yet you were glad indeed to receive our aid when you \n",
      "came at last to these shores, fainthearted loiterers, and \n",
      "wellnigh emptyhanded. In huts on the beaches would yon be \n",
      "dwelling still, had not the Noldor carved out your haven and \n",
      "toiled upon your walls.' \n",
      "\n",
      "But Olwe answered: 'We renounce no friendship. But it \n",
      "may be the part of a friend to rebuke a friend's folly. And \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "when the Noldor welcomed us and gave us aid, otherwise \n",
      "then you spoke: in the land of Aman we were to dwell for \n",
      "ever, as brothers whose houses stand side by side. But as \n",
      "for our white ships: those you gave us not. We learned not \n",
      "that craft from the Noldor, but from the Lords of the Sea; \n",
      "and the white timbers we wrought with our own hands, and \n",
      "the white sails were woven by our wives and our daughters. \n",
      "Therefore we will neither give them nor sell them for any \n",
      "league or friendship. For I say to you, Feanor son of Finwe, \n",
      "these are to us as are the gems of the Noldor: the work of \n",
      "our hearts, whose like we shall not make again.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Thereupon Feanor left him, and sat in dark thought \n",
      "beyond the walls of Alqualonde, until his host was \n",
      "assembled. When he judged that his strength was enough, \n",
      "he went to the Haven of the Swans and began to man the \n",
      "ships that were anchored there and to take them away by \n",
      "force. But the Teleri withstood him, and cast many of the \n",
      "Noldor into the sea. Then swords were drawn, and a bitter \n",
      "fight was fought upon the ships, and about the lamplit quays \n",
      "and piers of the Haven, and even upon the great arch of its \n",
      "gate. Thrice the people of Feanor were driven back, and \n",
      "many were slain upon either side; but the vanguard of the \n",
      "Noldor were succoured by Fingon with the foremost of the \n",
      "host of Fingolfin, who coming up found a battle joined and \n",
      "their own kin falling, and rushed in before they knew rightly \n",
      "the cause of the quarrel; some thought indeed that the \n",
      "Teleri had sought to waylay the march of the Noldor at the \n",
      "bidding of the Valar. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus at last the Teleri were overcome, and a great part \n",
      "of their mariners that dwelt in Alqualonde were wickedly \n",
      "slain. For the Noldor were become fierce and desperate, \n",
      "and the Teleri had less strength, and were armed for the \n",
      "most part but with slender bows. Then the Noldor drew \n",
      "away their white ships and manned their oars as best they \n",
      "might, and rowed them north along the coast. And Olwe \n",
      "called upon Osse, but he came not, for it was not permitted \n",
      "by the Valar that the fight of the Noldor should be hindered \n",
      "by force. But Uinen wept for the mariners of the Teleri; and \n",
      "the sea rose in wrath against the slayers, so that many of \n",
      "the ships were wrecked and those in them drowned. Of the \n",
      "enslaving at Alqualonde more is told in that lament which is \n",
      "named Noldolante, the Fall of the Noldor, that Maglor \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "made ere he was lost. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless the greater part of the Noldor escaped, \n",
      "and when the storm was past they held on their course, \n",
      "some by ship and some by land; but the way was long and \n",
      "ever more evil as they went forward. After they had \n",
      "marched for a great while in the unmeasured night, they \n",
      "came at length to the northern confines of the Guarded \n",
      "Realm, upon the borders of the empty waste of Araman \n",
      "which were mountainous and cold. There they beheld \n",
      "suddenly a dark figure standing high upon a rock that \n",
      "looked down upon the shore. Some say that it was Mandos \n",
      "himself, and no lesser herald of Manwe. And they heard a \n",
      "loud voice, solemn and terrible, that bade them stand and \n",
      "give ear. Then all halted and stood still, and from end to end \n",
      "of the hosts of the Noldor the voice was heard speaking the \n",
      "curse and prophecy which is called the Prophecy of the \n",
      "North, and the Doom of the Noldor. Much it foretold in dark \n",
      "words, which the Noldor understood not until the woes \n",
      "indeed after befell them; but all heard the curse that was \n",
      "uttered upon those that would not stay nor seek the doom \n",
      "and pardon of the Valar. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Tears unnumbered ye shall shed; and the Valar will \n",
      "fence Valinor against you, and shut you out, so that not \n",
      "even the echo of your lamentation shall pass over the \n",
      "mountains. On the House of Feanor the wrath of the Valar \n",
      "lieth from the West unto the uttermost East, and upon all \n",
      "that will follow them it shall be laid also. Their Oath shall \n",
      "drive them, and yet betray them, and ever snatch away the \n",
      "very treasures that they have sworn to pursue. To evil end \n",
      "shall all things turn that they begin well; and by treason of \n",
      "kin unto kin, and the fear of treason, shall this come to \n",
      "pass. The Dispossessed shall they be for ever. \n",
      "\n",
      "'Ye have spilled the blood of your kindred unrighteously \n",
      "and have stained the land of Aman. For blood ye shall \n",
      "render blood, and beyond Aman ye shall dwell in Death's \n",
      "shadow. For though Eru appointed to you to die not in Ea, \n",
      "and no sickness may assail you, yet slain ye may be, and \n",
      "slain ye shall be: by weapon and by torment and by grief; \n",
      "and your houseless spirits shall come then to Mandos. \n",
      "There long shall ye abide and yearn for your bodies, and \n",
      "find little pity though all whom ye have slain should entreat \n",
      "for you. And those that endure in Middle-earth and come \n",
      "not to Mandos shall grow weary of the world as with a great \n",
      "burden, and shall wane, and become as shadows of regret \n",
      "before the younger race that cometh after. The Valar have \n",
      "spoken.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then many quailed; but Feanor hardened his heart and \n",
      "said: 'We have sworn, and not lightly. This oath we will \n",
      "keep. We are threatened with many evils, and treason not \n",
      "least; but one thing is not said: that we shall suffer from \n",
      "cowardice, from cravens or the fear of cravens. Therefore I \n",
      "say that we will go on, and this doom I add: the deeds that \n",
      "we shall do shall be the matter of song until the last days of \n",
      "Arda.' \n",
      "\n",
      "But in that hour Finarfin forsook the march, and turned \n",
      "back, being filled with grief, and with bitterness against the \n",
      "House of Feanor, because of his kinship with Olwe of \n",
      "Alqualonde; and many of his people went with him, \n",
      "retracing their steps in sorrow, until they beheld once more \n",
      "the far beam of the Mindon upon Tuna still shining in the \n",
      "night, and so came at last to Valinor. There they received \n",
      "the pardon of the Valar, and Finarfin was set to rule the \n",
      "remnant of the Noldor in the Blessed Realm. But his sons \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "were not with him, for they would not forsake the sons of \n",
      "Fingolfin; and all Fingolfin's folk went forward still, feeling \n",
      "the constraint of their kinship and the will of Feanor, and \n",
      "fearing to face the doom of the Valar, since not all of them \n",
      "had been guiltless of the Kinslaying at Alqualonde. \n",
      "Moreover Fingon and Turgon were bold and fiery of heart, \n",
      "and loath to abandon any task to which they had put their \n",
      "hands until the bitter end, if bitter it must be. So the main \n",
      "host held on, and swiftly the evil that was foretold began its \n",
      "work. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Noldor came at last far into the north of Arda; and \n",
      "they saw the first teeth of the ice that floated in the sea, and \n",
      "knew that they were drawing nigh to the Flelcaraxe. For \n",
      "between the land of Aman that in the north curved \n",
      "eastward, and the east-shores of Endor (which is Middle- \n",
      "earth) that bore westward, there was a narrow strait, \n",
      "through which the chill waters of the Encircling Sea and the \n",
      "waves of Belegaer flowed together, and there were vast \n",
      "fogs and mists of deathly cold, and the sea-streams were \n",
      "filled with clashing hills of ice and the grinding of ice deep- \n",
      "sunken. Such was the Flelcaraxe, and there none yet had \n",
      "dared to tread save the Valar only and Ungoliant \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore Feanor halted and the Noldor debated what \n",
      "course they should now take. But they began to suffer \n",
      "anguish from the cold, and the clinging mists through which \n",
      "no gleam of star could pierce; and many repented of the \n",
      "road and began to murmur, especially those that followed \n",
      "Fingolfin, cursing Feanor, and naming him as the cause of \n",
      "all the woes of the Eldar. But Feanor, knowing all that was \n",
      "said, took counsel with his sons; and two courses only they \n",
      "saw to escape from Araman and come into Endor: by the \n",
      "straits or by ship. But the Flelcaraxe they deemed \n",
      "impassable, whereas the ships were too few. Many had \n",
      "been lost upon their long journey, and there remained now \n",
      "not enough to bear across all the great host together; yet \n",
      "none were willing to abide upon the western coast while \n",
      "others were ferried first: already the fear of treachery was \n",
      "awake among the Noldor. Therefore it came into the hearts \n",
      "of Feanor and his sons to seize all the ships and depart \n",
      "suddenly; for they had retained the mastery of the fleet \n",
      "since the battle of the Flaven, and it was manned only by \n",
      "those who had fought there and were bound to Feanor. And \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "as though it came at his call, there sprang up a wind from \n",
      "the north-west, and Feanor slipped away secretly with all \n",
      "whom he deemed true to him, and went aboard, and put out \n",
      "to sea, and left Fingolfin in Araman. And since the sea was \n",
      "there narrow, steering east and somewhat south he passed \n",
      "over without loss, and first of all the Noldor set foot once \n",
      "more upon the shores of Middle-earth; and the landing of \n",
      "Feanor was at the mouth of the firth which was called \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But when they were landed, Maedhros the eldest of his \n",
      "sons, and on a time the friend of Fingon ere Morgoth's lies \n",
      "came between, spoke to Feanor, saying: 'Now what ships \n",
      "and rowers will you spare to return, and whom shall they \n",
      "bear hither first? Fingon the valiant?' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Feanor laughed as one fey, and he cried: 'None \n",
      "and none! What I have left behind I count now no loss; \n",
      "needless baggage on the road it has proved. Let those that \n",
      "cursed my name, curse me still, and whine their way back \n",
      "to the cages of the Valar! Let the ships burn!' Then \n",
      "Maedhros alone stood aside, but Feanor caused fire to be \n",
      "set to the white ships of the Teleri. So in that place which \n",
      "was called Losgar at the outlet of the Firth of Drengist \n",
      "ended the fairest vessels that ever sailed the sea, in a \n",
      "great burning, bright and terrible. And Fingolfin and his \n",
      "people saw the light afar off, red beneath the clouds; and \n",
      "they knew that they were betrayed. This was the firstfruits of \n",
      "the Kinslaying and the Doom of the Noldor. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Fingolfin seeing that Feanor had left him to \n",
      "perish in Araman or return in shame to Valinor was filled \n",
      "with bitterness; but he desired now as never before to \n",
      "come by some way to Middle-earth, and meet Feanor \n",
      "again. And he and his host wandered long in misery, but \n",
      "their valour and endurance grew with hardship; for they \n",
      "were a mighty people, the elder children undying of Eru \n",
      "lluvatar, but new-come from the Blessed Realm, and not yet \n",
      "weary with the weariness of Earth. The fire of their hearts \n",
      "was young, and led by Fingolfin and his sons, and by \n",
      "Finrod and Galadriel, they dared to pass into the bitterest \n",
      "North; and finding no other way they endured at last the \n",
      "terror of the Helcaraxe and the cruel hills of ice. Few of the \n",
      "deeds of the Noldor thereafter surpassed that desperate \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "crossing in hardihood or woe. There Elenwe the wife of \n",
      "Turgon was lost, and many others perished also; and it was \n",
      "with a lessened host that Fingolfin set foot at last upon the \n",
      "Outer Lands. Small love for Feanor or his sons had those \n",
      "that marched at last behind him, and blew their trumpets in \n",

      "Now as has been told the power of Elwe and Melian \n",

      "from the mariners of Cirdan to the wandering hunters of the \n",
      "Blue Mountains beyond the River Gelion, owned Elwe as \n",

      "Grey-elves of starlit Beleriand; and although they were \n",

      "of Melian they became the fairest and the most wise and \n",
      "skilful of all the Elves of Middle-earth. And at the end of the \n",
      "first age of the Chaining of Melkor, when all the Earth had \n",
      "peace and the glory of Valinor was at its noon, there came \n",
      "into the world Luthien, the only child of Thingol and Melian. \n",
      "Though Middle-earth lay for the most part in the Sleep of \n",
      "Yavanna, in Beleriand under the power of Melian there was \n",
      "life and joy, and the bright stars shone as silver fires; and \n",
      "there in the forest of Neldoreth Luthien was born, and the \n",
      "white flowers of niphredil came forth to greet her as stars \n",
      "from the earth. \n",
      "\n",
      "It came to pass during the second age of the captivity \n",
      "of Melkor that Dwarves came over the Blue Mountains of \n",
      "Ered Luin into Beleriand. Themselves they named Khazad, \n",
      "but the Sindar called them Naugrim, the Stunted People, \n",
      "and Gonnhirrim, Masters of Stone. Far to the east were the \n",
      "most ancient dwellings of the Naugrim, but they had delved \n",
      "for themselves great halls and mansions, after the manner \n",
      "of their kind, in the eastern side of Ered Luin; and those \n",
      "cities were named in their own tongue Gabilgathol and \n",
      "Tumunzahar. To the north of the great height of Mount \n",
      "Dolmed was Gabilgathol, which the Elves interpreted in \n",
      "their tongue Belegost, that is Mickleburg; and southward \n",
      "was delved Tumunzahar, by the Elves named Nogrod, the \n",
      "Hollowbold. Greatest of all the mansions of the Dwarves \n",
      "was Khazad-dum, the Dwarrowdelf, Hadhodrond in the \n",
      "Elvish tongue, that was afterwards in the days of its \n",

      "Mist beyond the wide leagues of Eriador, and to the Eldar \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "came but as a name and a rumour from the words of the \n",
      "Dwarves of the Blue Mountains. \n",
      "\n",
      "From Nogrod and Belegost the Naugrim came forth \n",
      "into Beleriand; and the Elves were filled with amazement, \n",
      "for they had believed themselves to be the only living things \n",
      "in Middle-earth that spoke with words or wrought with \n",
      "hands, and that all others were but birds and beasts. But \n",
      "they could understand no word of the tongue of the \n",
      "Naugrim, which to their ears was cumbrous and unlovely; \n",
      "and few ever of the Eldar have achieved the mastery of it \n",
      "But the Dwarves were swift to learn, and indeed were more \n",
      "willing to learn the Elventongue than to teach their own to \n",
      "those of alien race. Few of the Eldar went ever to Nogrod \n",
      "and Belegost, save Eol of Nan Elmoth and Maeglin his son; \n",
      "but the Dwarves trafficked into Beleriand, and they made a \n",
      "great road that passed under the shoulders of Mount \n",
      "Dolmed and followed the course of the River Ascar, \n",
      "crossing Gelion at Sam Athrad, the Ford of Stones, where \n",
      "battle after befell. Ever cool was the friendship between the \n",
      "Naugrim and the Eldar, though much profit they had one of \n",
      "the other; but at that time those griefs that lay between them \n",
      "had not yet come to pass, and King Thingol welcomed \n",
      "them. But the Naugrim gave their friendship more readily to \n",
      "the Noldor in after days than to any others of Elves and \n",
      "Men, because of their love and reverence for Aule; and the \n",
      "gems of the Noldor they praised above all other wealth. In \n",
      "the darkness of Arda already the Dwarves wrought great \n",
      "works, for even from the first days of their Fathers they had \n",
      "marvellous skill with metals and with stone; but in that \n",
      "ancient time iron and copper they loved to work, rather than \n",
      "silver or gold. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now Melian had much foresight, after the manner of \n",
      "the Maiar; and when the second age of the captivity of \n",
      "Melkor had passed, she counselled Thingol that the Peace \n",
      "of Arda would not last for ever. He took thought therefore \n",
      "how he should make for himself a kingly dwelling, and a \n",
      "place that should be strong, if evil were to awake again in \n",
      "Middle-earth; and he sought aid and counsel of the \n",
      "Dwarves of Belegost They gave it willingly, for they were \n",
      "unwearied in those days and eager for new works; and \n",
      "though the Dwarves ever demanded a price for all that they \n",
      "did, whether with delight or with toil, at this time they held \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "themselves paid. For Melian taught them much that they \n",
      "were eager to learn, and Thingol rewarded them with many \n",
      "fair pearls. These Cirdan gave to him, for they were got in \n",
      "great number in the shallow waters about the Isle of Balar; \n",
      "but the Naugrim had not before seen their like, and they \n",
      "held them dear. One there was as great as a dove's egg, \n",
      "and its sheen was as starlight on the foam of the sea; \n",
      "Nimphelos it was named, and the chieftain of the Dwarves \n",
      "of Belegost prized it above a mountain of wealth. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore the Naugrim laboured long and gladly for \n",
      "Thingol, and devised for him mansions after the fashion of \n",
      "their people, delved deep in the earth. Where the Esgalduin \n",
      "flowed down, and parted Neldoreth from Region, there rose \n",
      "in the midst of the forest a rocky hill, and the river ran at its \n",
      "feet. There they made the gates of the hall of Thingol, and \n",
      "they built a bridge of stone over the river, by which alone the \n",
      "gates could be entered. Beyond the gates wide passages \n",
      "ran down to high halls and chambers far below that were \n",
      "hewn in the living stone, so many and so great that that \n",
      "dwelling was named Menegroth, the Thousand Caves. \n",
      "\n",
      "But the Elves also had part in that labour, and Elves \n",
      "and Dwarves together, each with their own skill, there \n",
      "wrought out the visions of Melian, images of the wonder \n",
      "and beauty of Valinor beyond the Sea. The pillars of \n",
      "Menegroth were hewn in the likeness of the beeches of \n",
      "Orome, stock, bough, and leaf, and they were lit with \n",
      "lanterns of gold. The nightingales sang there as in the \n",
      "gardens of Lorien; and there were fountains of silver, and \n",
      "basins of marble, and floors of many-coloured stones. \n",
      "Carven figures of beasts and birds there ran upon the walls, \n",
      "or climbed upon the pillars, or peered among the branches \n",
      "entwined with many flowers. And as the years passed \n",
      "Melian and her maidens filled the halls with woven hangings \n",
      "wherein could be read the deeds of the Valar, and many \n",
      "things that had befallen in Arda since its beginning, and \n",
      "shadows of things that were yet to be. That was the fairest \n",
      "dwelling of any king that has ever been east of the Sea. \n",
      "\n",
      "And when the building of Menegroth was achieved, \n",
      "and there was peace in the realm of Thingol and Melian, \n",
      "the Naugrim yet came ever and anon over the mountains \n",
      "and went in traffic about the lands; but they went seldom to \n",
      "the Falas, for they hated the sound of the sea and feared to \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "look upon it. To Beleriand there came no other rumour or \n",
      "tidings of the world without. \n",
      "\n",
      "But as the third age of the captivity of Melkor drew on, \n",
      "the Dwarves became troubled, and they spoke to King \n",
      "Thingol, saying that the Valar had not rooted out utterly the \n",
      "evils of the North, and now the remnant, having long \n",
      "multiplied in the dark, were coming forth once more and \n",
      "roaming far and wide. There are fell beasts,' they said, 'in \n",
      "the land east of the mountains, and your ancient kindred \n",
      "that dwell there are flying from the plains to the hills.' \n",
      "\n",
      "And ere long the evil creatures came even to \n",
      "Beleriand, over passes in the mountains, or up from the \n",
      "south through the dark forests. Wolves there were, or \n",
      "creatures that walked in wolf-shapes, and other fell beings \n",
      "of shadow; and among them were the Ores, who afterwards \n",
      "wrought ruin in Beleriand: but they were yet few and wary, \n",
      "and did but smell out the ways of the land, awaiting the \n",
      "return of their lord. Whence they came, or what they were, \n",
      "the Elves knew not then, thinking them perhaps to be Avari \n",
      "who had become evil and savage in the wild; in which they \n",
      "guessed all too near, it is said. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore Thingol took thought for arms, which before \n",
      "his people had not needed, and these at first the Naugrim \n",
      "smithied for him; for they were greatly skilled in such work, \n",
      "though none among them surpassed the craftsmen of \n",
      "Nogrod, of whom Telchar the smith was greatest in renown. \n",
      "A warlike race of old were all the Naugrim, and they would \n",
      "fight fiercely against whomsoever aggrieved them: servants \n",
      "of Melkor, or Eldar, or Avari, or wild beasts, or not seldom \n",
      "their own kin, Dwarves of other mansions and lordships. \n",
      "Their smithcraft indeed the Sindar soon learned of them; \n",
      "yet in the tempering of steel alone of all crafts the Dwarves \n",
      "were never outmatched even by the Noldor, and in the \n",
      "making of mail of linked rings, which was first contrived by \n",
      "the smiths of Belegost, their work had no rival. \n",
      "\n",
      "At this time therefore the Sindar were well-armed, and \n",
      "they drove off an creatures of evil, and had peace again; \n",
      "but Thingol's armouries were stored with axes and with \n",
      "spears and swords, and tall helms, and long coats of bright \n",
      "mail; for the hauberks of the Dwarves were so fashioned \n",
      "that they rusted not but shone ever as if they were new- \n",
      "burnished. And that proved well for Thingol in the time that \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "was to come. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Now as has been told, one Lenwe of the host of Olwe \n",
      "forsook the march of the Eldar at that time when the Teleri \n",
      "were halted by the shores of the Great River upon the \n",
      "borders of the westlands of Middle-earth. Little is known of \n",
      "the wanderings of the Nandor, whom he led away down \n",
      "Anduin: some, it is said, dwelt age-long in the woods of the \n",
      "Vale of the Great River, some came at last to its mouths \n",
      "and there dwelt by the Sea, and yet others passing by Ered \n",
      "Nimrais, the White Mountains, came north again and \n",
      "entered the wilderness of Eriador between Ered Luin and \n",
      "the far Mountains of Mist. Now these were a woodland \n",
      "people and had no weapons of steel, and the coming of the \n",
      "fell beasts of the North filled them with great fear, as the \n",
      "Naugrim declared to King Thingol in Menegroth. Therefore \n",
      "Denethor, the son of Lenwe, hearing rumour of the might of \n",
      "Thingol and his majesty, and of the peace of his realm, \n",
      "gathered such host of his scattered people as he could, \n",
      "and led them over the mountains into Beleriand. There they \n",
      "were welcomed by Thingol, as kin long lost that return, and \n",
      "they dwelt in Ossiriand, the Land of Seven Rivers. \n",
      "\n",
      "Of the long years of peace that followed after the \n",
      "coming of Denethor there is little tale. In those days, it is \n",
      "said, Daeron the Minstrel, chief loremaster of the kingdom \n",
      "of Thingol, devised his Runes; and the Naugrim that came \n",
      "to Thingol learned them, and were well-pleased with the \n",
      "device, esteeming Daeron's skill higher than did the \n",
      "Sindar, his own people. By the Naugrim the Cirth were \n",
      "taken east over the mountains and passed into the \n",
      "knowledge of many peoples; but they were little used by the \n",
      "Sindar for the keeping of records, until the days of the War, \n",
      "and much that was held in memory perished in the ruins of \n",
      "Doriath. But of bliss and glad life there is little to be said, \n",
      "before it ends; as works fair and wonderful, while still they \n",
      "endure for eyes to see, are their own record, and only when \n",
      "they are in peril or broken for ever do they pass into song. \n",
      "\n",
      "In Beleriand in those days the Elves walked, and the \n",
      "rivers flowed, and the stars shone, and the night-flowers \n",
      "gave forth their scents; and the beauty of Melian was as the \n",
      "noon, and the beauty of Luthien was as the dawn in spring. \n",
      "In Beleriand King Thingol upon his throne was as the lords \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "of the Maiar, whose power is at rest, whose joy is as an air \n",
      "that they breathe in all their days, whose thought flows in a \n",
      "tide untroubled from the heights to the deeps. In Beleriand \n",
      "still at times rode Orome the great, passing like a wind over \n",
      "the mountains, and the sound of his horn came down the \n",
      "leagues of the starlight, and the Elves feared him for the \n",

      "Trees of the Valar with the aid of Ungoliant, and escaped, \n",
      "and came back to Middle-earth. Far to the north befell the \n",
      "strife of Morgoth and Ungoliant; but the great cry of Morgoth \n",
      "echoed through Beleriand, and all its people shrank for \n",
      "fear; for though they knew not what it foreboded, they heard \n",
      "then the herald of death. Soon afterwards Ungoliant fled \n",
      "from the north and came into the realm of King Thingol, and \n",
      "a terror of darkness was about her; but by the power of \n",
      "Melian she was stayed, and entered not into Neldoreth, but \n",
      "abode long time under the shadow of the precipices in \n",
      "which Dorthonion fell southward. And they became known \n",
      "as Ered Gorgoroth, the Mountains of Terror, and none \n",
      "dared go thither, or pass nigh them; there life and light were \n",
      "strangled, and there all waters were poisoned. But \n",
      "Morgoth, as has before been told, returned to Angband, \n",
      "and built it anew, and above its doors he reared the reeking \n",
      "towers of Thangorodrim; and the gates of Morgoth were but \n",
      "one hundred and fifty leagues distant from the bridge of \n",
      "Menegroth: far and yet all too near. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now the Ores that multiplied in the darkness of the \n",
      "earth grew strong and fell, and their dark lord filled them \n",
      "with a lust of rain and death; and they issued from \n",
      "Angband's gates under the clouds that Morgoth sent forth, \n",
      "and passed silently into the highlands of the north. Thence \n",
      "on a sudden a great army came into Beleriand and \n",
      "assailed King Thingol. Now in his wide realm many Elves \n",
      "wandered free in the wild, or dwelt at peace in small \n",
      "kindreds far sundered; and only about Menegroth in the \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "midst of the land, and along the Falas in the country of the \n",

      "came down upon either side of Menegroth, and from \n",
      "camps in the east between Celon and Gelion, and west in \n",
      "the plains between Sirion and Narog, they plundered far \n",
      "and wide; and Thingol was cut on from Cirdan at Eglarest. \n",
      "Therefore he called upon Denethor; and the Elves came in \n",
      "force from Region beyond Arcs and from Ossiriand, and \n",
      "fought the first battle in the Wars of Beleriand. And the \n",
      "eastern host of the Ores was taken between the armies of \n",
      "the Eldar, north of the Andram and midway between Aros \n",
      "and Gelion, and there they were utterly defeated, and those \n",
      "that fled north from the great slaughter were waylaid by the \n",
      "axes of the Naugrim that issued from Mount Dolmed: few \n",
      "indeed returned to Angband. \n",
      "\n",
      "But the victory of the Elves was dear-bought For those \n",
      "of Ossiriand were light-armed, and no match for the Ores, \n",
      "who were shod with iron and iron-shielded and bore great \n",
      "spears with broad blades; and Denethor was cut off and \n",
      "surrounded upon the hill of Amon Ereb. There he fell and all \n",
      "his nearest kin about him, before the host of Thingol could \n",
      "come to his aid. Bitterly though his fall was avenged, when \n",
      "Thingol came upon the rear of the Ores and slew them in \n",
      "heaps, his people lamented him ever after and took no king \n",
      "again. After the battle some returned to Ossiriand, and their \n",
      "tidings filled the remnant of their people with great fear, so \n",
      "that thereafter they came never forth in open war, but kept \n",
      "themselves by wariness and secrecy; and they were called \n",
      "the Laiquendi, the Green-elves, because of their raiment of \n",
      "the colour of leaves. But many went north and entered the \n",
      "guarded realm of Thingol, and were merged with his \n",
      "people. \n",
      "\n",
      "And when Thingol came again to Menegroth he \n",
      "learned that the Ore-host in the west was victorious, and \n",
      "had driven Cirdan to the rim of the sea. Therefore he \n",
      "withdrew all his people that his summons could reach within \n",
      "the fastness of Neldoreth and Region, and Melian put forth \n",
      "her power and fenced all that dominion round about with an \n",
      "unseen wail of shadow and bewilderment: the Girdle of \n",
      "Melian, that none thereafter could pass against her will or \n",

      "world had moonlight, and many things stirred and woke that \n",
      "had waited long in the sleep of Yavanna. The servants of \n",
      "Morgoth were filled with amazement, but the Elves of the \n",
      "Outer Lands looked up in delight; and even as the Moon \n",
      "rose above the darkness in the west, Fingolfin let blow his \n",

      "Tilion had traversed the heaven seven times, and thus \n",
      "was in the furthest east, when the vessel of Arien was made \n",
      "ready. Then Anar arose in glory, and the first dawn of the \n",
      "Sun was like a great fire upon the towers of the Pelori: the \n",
      "clouds of Middle-earth were kindled, and there was heard \n",
      "the sound of many waterfalls. Then indeed Morgoth was \n",
      "dismayed, and he descended into the uttermost depths of \n",
      "Angband, and withdrew his servants, sending forth great \n",

      "of the Earth. But Tilion was wayward and uncertain in \n",
      "speed, and held not to his appointed path; and he sought to \n",
      "come near to Arien, being drawn by her splendour, though \n",
      "the flame of Anar scorched him, and the island of the Moon \n",
      "was darkened. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of the waywardness of Tilion, therefore, and \n",
      "yet more because of the prayers of Lorien and Este, who \n",
      "said that sleep and rest had been banished from the Earth, \n",
      "and the stars were hidden, Varda changed her counsel, \n",
      "and allowed a time wherein the world should still have \n",
      "shadow and half-light. Anar rested therefore a while in \n",
      "Valinor, lying upon the cool bosom of the Outer Sea; and \n",
      "Evening, the time of the descent and resting of the Sun, \n",
      "was the hour of greatest light and joy in Aman. But soon the \n",
      "Sun was drawn down by the servants of Ulmo, and went \n",
      "then in haste under the Earth, and so came unseen to the \n",
      "east and there mounted the heaven again, lest night be \n",
      "over-long and evil walk under the Moon. But by Anar the \n",
      "waters of the Outer Sea were made hot and glowed with \n",
      "coloured fire, and Valinor had light for a while after the \n",
      "passing of Arien. Yet as she journeyed under the Earth and \n",
      "drew towards the east the glow faded and Valinor was dim, \n",
      "and the Valar mourned then most for the death of Laurelin. \n",
      "At dawn the shadows of the Mountains of Defence lay \n",
      "heavy on the Blessed Realm. \n",
      "\n",
      "Varda commanded the Moon to journey in like manner, \n",
      "and passing under Earth to arise in the east, but only after \n",
      "the Sun had descended from heaven. But Tilion went with \n",
      "uncertain pace, as yet he goes, and was still drawn towards \n",
      "Arien, as he shall ever be; so that often both may be seen \n",
      "above the Earth together, or at times it will chance that he \n",
      "comes so nigh that his shadow cuts off her brightness and \n",
      "there is a darkness amid the day. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore by the coming and going of Anar the Valar \n",
      "reckoned the days thereafter until the Change of the World. \n",
      "For Tilion tamed seldom in Valinor, but more often would \n",
      "pass swiftly over the western land, over Avathar, or \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Araman, or Valinor, and plunge in the chasm beyond the \n",
      "Outer Sea, pursuing his way alone amid the grots and \n",
      "caverns at the roots of Arda. There he would often wander \n",
      "long, and late would return. \n",
      "\n",
      "Still therefore, after the Long Night, the light of Valinor \n",
      "was greater and fairer than upon Middle-earth; for the Sun \n",
      "rested there, and the lights of heaven drew nearer to Earth \n",
      "in that region. But neither the Sun nor the Moon can recall \n",
      "the light that was of old, that came from the Trees before \n",
      "they were touched by the poison of Ungoliant That light lives \n",
      "now in the Silmarils alone. \n",
      "\n",
      "But Morgoth hated the new lights, and was for a while \n",
      "confounded by this unlooked-for stroke of the Valar. Then \n",
      "he assailed Tilion, sending spirits of shadow against him, \n",
      "and there was strife in Ilmen beneath the paths of the stars; \n",
      "but Tilion was victorious. And Arien Morgoth feared with a \n",
      "great fear, but dared not come nigh her, having indeed no \n",
      "longer the power; for as he grew in malice, and sent forth \n",
      "from himself the evil that he conceived in lies and creatures \n",
      "of wickedness, his might passed into them and was \n",
      "dispersed, and he himself became ever more bound to the \n",
      "earth, unwilling to issue from his dark strongholds. With \n",
      "shadows he hid himself and his servants from Arien, the \n",
      "glance of whose eyes they could not long endure; and the \n",
      "lands near his dwelling were shrouded in fumes and great \n",
      "clouds. \n",
      "\n",
      "But seeing the assault upon Tilion the Valar were in \n",
      "doubt, fearing what the malice and cunning of Morgoth \n",
      "might yet contrive against them. Being unwilling to make \n",
      "war upon him in Middle-earth, they remembered \n",
      "nonetheless the ruin of Almaren; and they resolved that the \n",
      "like should not befall Valinor. Therefore at that time they \n",
      "fortified their land anew, and they raised up the mountain- \n",
      "walls of the Pelori to sheer and dreadful heights, east, \n",
      "north, and south. Their outer sides were dark and smooth, \n",
      "without foothold or ledge, and they fell in great precipices \n",
      "with faces hard as glass, and rose up to towers with crowns \n",
      "of white ice. A sleepless watch was set upon them, and no \n",
      "pass led through them, save only at the Calacirya: but that \n",
      "pass the Valar did not close, because of the Eldar that \n",
      "were faithful, and in the city of Tlrion upon the green hill \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Vanyar and Ingwe their lord, must breathe at times the outer \n",
      "air and the wind that comes over the sea from the lands of \n",
      "their birth; and the Valar would not sunder the Teleri wholly \n",
      "from their kin. But in the Calacirya they set strong towers \n",
      "and many sentinels, and at its issue upon the plains of \n",

      "loved them, and have not understood the purposes of the \n",
      "Powers, being at variance with them, and at strife with the \n",

      "not the messages. Yet it is told that ere long they met Dark \n",
      "Elves in many places, and were befriended by them; and \n",
      "Men became the companions and disciples in their \n",
      "childhood of these ancient folk, wanderers of the Elven- \n",

      "Morgoth had then not long come back into Middle- \n",
      "earth, and his power went not far abroad, and was \n",
      "moreover checked by the sudden coming of great light. \n",
      "There was little peril in the lands and hills; and there new \n",
      "things, devised long ages before in the thought of Yavanna \n",
      "and sown as seed in the dark, came at last to their budding \n",

      "strove against the hosts of Morgoth Bauglir, and went down \n",
      "in ruin. To this end the cunning lies of Morgoth that he \n",
      "sowed of old, and sowed ever anew among his foes, and \n",
      "the curse that came of the slaying at Alqualonde, and the \n",
      "oath of Feanor, were ever at work. Only a part is here told \n",
      "of the deeds of those days, and most is said of the Noldor, \n",
      "and the Silmarils, and the mortals that became entangled in \n",
      "their fate. In those days Elves and Men were of like stature \n",
      "and strength of body, but the Elves had greater wisdom, \n",
      "and skill, and beauty; and those who had dwelt in Valinor \n",
      "and looked upon the Powers as much surpassed the Dark \n",
      "Elves in these things as they in turn surpassed the people \n",
      "of mortal race. Only to the realm of Doriath, whose queen \n",

      "age to age, and no sickness nor pestilence brought death \n",

      "could be destroyed; and in those days they were more like \n",

      "inhabited by the fire of their spirit, which consumes them \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "from within in the courses of time. But Men were more frail, \n",
      "more easily slain by weapon or mischance, and less easily \n",
      "healed; subject to sickness and many ills; and they grew old \n",
      "and died. What may befall their spirits after death the Elves \n",
      "know not. Some say that they too go to the halls of Mandos; \n",
      "but their place of waiting there is not that of the Elves, and \n",
      "Mandos under lluvatar alone save Manwe knows whither \n",
      "they go after the time of recollection in those silent halls \n",
      "beside the Outer Sea. None have ever come back from the \n",
      "mansions of the dead, save only Beren son of Barahir, \n",
      "whose hand had touched a Silmaril; but he never spoke \n",
      "afterward to mortal Men. The fate of Men after death, \n",

      "woods and caves, becoming as shadows and memories, \n",
      "save those who ever and anon set sail into the West and \n",
      "vanished from Middle-earth. But in the dawn of years Elves \n",

      "Losgar, came through the passes of Ered Wethrin, the \n",
      "Mountains of Shadow, and assailed Feanor on a sudden, \n",
      "before his camp was full-wrought or put in defence; and \n",
      "there on the grey fields of Mithrim was fought the Second \n",
      "Battle in the Wars of Beleriand. Dagor-nuin-Giliath it is \n",
      "named, the Battle-under-Stars, for the Moon had not yet \n",

      "light of Aman was not yet dimmed in their eyes, and they \n",
      "were strong and swift, and deadly in anger, and their \n",
      "swords were long and terrible. The Ores fled before them, \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "and they were driven forth from Mithrim with great slaughter, \n",
      "and hunted over the Mountains of Shadow into the great \n",
      "plain of Ard-galen, that lay northward of Dorthonion. There \n",
      "the armies of Morgoth that had passed south into the Vale \n",
      "of Sirion and beleaguered Cirdan in the Havens of the \n",
      "Falas came up to their aid, and were caught in their ruin. \n",
      "For Celegorm, Feanor's son, having news of them, waylaid \n",
      "them with a part of the Elven-host, and coming down upon \n",
      "them out of the hills near Eithel Sirion drove them into the \n",
      "Fen of Serech. Evil indeed were the tidings that came at \n",
      "last to Angband, and Morgoth was dismayed. Ten days that \n",
      "battle lasted, and from it returned of all the hosts that he had \n",
      "prepared for the conquest of Beleriand no more than a \n",
      "handful of leaves. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yet cause he had for great joy, though it was hidden \n",
      "from him for a while. For Feanor, in his wrath against the \n",
      "Enemy, would not halt, but pressed on behind the remnant \n",
      "of the Ores, thinking so to come at Morgoth himself: and he \n",
      "laughed aloud as he wielded his sword, rejoicing that he \n",
      "had dared the wrath of the Valar and the evils of the road, \n",
      "that he might see the hour of his vengeance. Nothing did he \n",
      "know of Angband or the great strength of defence that \n",
      "Morgoth had so swiftly prepared: but even had he known it \n",
      "would not have deterred him, for he was fey, consumed by \n",
      "the flame of his own wrath. Thus it was that he drew far \n",
      "ahead of the van of his host; and seeing this the servants of \n",
      "Morgoth turned to bay, and there issued from Angband \n",
      "Balrogs to aid them. There upon the confines of Dor \n",
      "Daedeloth, the land of Morgoth, Feanor was surrounded, \n",
      "with few friends about him. Long he fought on, and \n",
      "undismayed, though he was wrapped in fire and wounded \n",
      "with many wounds; but at the last he was smitten to the \n",
      "ground by Gothmog, Lord of Balrogs, whom Ecthelion after \n",
      "slew in Gondolin. There he would have perished, had not \n",
      "his sons in that moment come up with force to his aid; and \n",
      "the Balrogs left him, and departed to Angband. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then his sons raised up their father and bore him back \n",
      "towards Mithrim. But as they drew near to Eithel Sirion and \n",
      "were upon the upward path to the pass over the mountains, \n",
      "Feanor bade them halt; for his wounds were mortal, and he \n",
      "knew that his hour was come. And looking out from the \n",
      "slopes of Ered Wethrin with his last sight he beheld far off \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the peaks of Thangorodrim, mightiest of the towers of \n",
      "Middle-earth, and knew with the foreknowledge of death \n",
      "that no power of the Noldor would ever overthrow them; but \n",
      "he cursed the name of Morgoth thrice, and laid it upon his \n",
      "sons to hold to their oath, and to avenge their father. Then \n",
      "he died; but he had neither burial nor tomb, for so fiery was \n",
      "his spirit that as it sped his body fell to ash, and was borne \n",
      "away like smoke; and his likeness has never again \n",
      "appeared in Arda, neither has his spirit left the halls of \n",
      "Mandos. Thus ended the mightiest of the Noldor, of whose \n",
      "deeds came both their greatest renown and their most \n",
      "grievous woe. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now in Mithrim there dwelt Grey-elves, folk of \n",
      "Beleriand that had wandered north over the mountains, and \n",
      "the Noldor met them with gladness, as kinsfolk long \n",
      "sundered; but speech at first was not easy between them, \n",
      "for in their long severance the tongues of the Calaquendi in \n",
      "Valinor and of the Moriquendi in Beleriand had drawn far \n",
      "apart. From the Elves of Mithrim the Noldor learned of the \n",
      "power of Elu Thingol, King in Doriath, and the girdle of \n",
      "enchantment that fenced his realm; and tidings of these \n",
      "great deeds in the north came south to Menegroth, and to \n",
      "the havens of Brithombar and Eglarest. Then all the Elves \n",
      "of Beleriand were filled with wonder and with hope at the \n",
      "coming of their mighty kindred, who thus returned unlocked- \n",
      "for from the West in the very hour of their need, believing \n",
      "indeed at first that they came as emissaries of the Valar to \n",
      "deliver them. \n",
      "\n",
      "But even in the hour of the death of Feanor an \n",
      "embassy came to his sons from Morgoth, acknowledging \n",
      "defeat, and offering terms, even to the surrender of a \n",
      "Silmaril. Then Maedhros the tall, the eldest son, persuaded \n",
      "his brothers to feign to treat with Morgoth, and to meet his \n",
      "emissaries at the place appointed; but the Noldor had as \n",
      "little thought of faith as had he. Wherefore each embassy \n",
      "came with greater force than was agreed; but Morgoth sent \n",
      "the more, and there were Balrogs. Maedhros was \n",
      "ambushed, and all his company were slain; but he himself \n",
      "was taken alive by the command of Morgoth, and brought \n",
      "to Angband. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the brothers of Maedhros drew back, and \n",
      "fortified a great camp in Hithlum; but Morgoth held \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Maedhros as hostage, and sent word that he would not \n",
      "release him unless the Noldor would forsake their war, \n",
      "returning into the West, or else departing far from Beleriand \n",
      "into the South of the world. But the sons of Feanor knew \n",
      "that Morgoth would betray them, and would not release \n",
      "Maedhros, whatsoever they might do; and they were \n",
      "constrained also by their oath, and might not for any cause \n",
      "forsake the war against their Enemy. Therefore Morgoth \n",
      "took Maedhros and hung him from the face of a precipice \n",
      "upon Thangorodrim, and he was caught to the rock by the \n",
      "wrist of his right hand in a band of steel. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now rumour came to the camp in Hithlum of the march \n",
      "of Fingolfin and those that followed him, who had crossed \n",
      "the Grinding Ice; and all the world lay then in wonder at the \n",
      "coming of the Moon. But as the host of Fingolfin marched \n",
      "into Mithrim the Sun rose flaming in the West; and Fingolfin \n",
      "unfurled his blue and silver banners, and blew his horns, \n",
      "and flowers sprang beneath his marching feet, and the \n",
      "ages of the stars were ended. At the uprising of the great \n",
      "light the servants of Morgoth fled into Angband, and \n",
      "Fingolfin passed unopposed through the fastness of Dor \n",
      "Daedeloth while his foes hid beneath the earth. Then the \n",
      "Elves smote upon the gates of Angband, and the challenge \n",
      "of their trumpets shook the towers of Thangorodrim; and \n",
      "Maedhros heard them amid his torment and cried aloud, \n",
      "but his voice was lost in the echoes of the stone. \n",
      "\n",
      "But Fingolfin, being of other temper than Feanor, and \n",
      "wary of the wiles of Morgoth, withdrew from Dor Daedeloth \n",
      "and turned back towards Mithrim, for he had heard tidings \n",
      "that there he should find the sons of Feanor, and he desired \n",
      "also to have the shield of the Mountains of Shadow while \n",
      "his people rested and grew strong; for he had seen the \n",
      "strength of Angband, and thought not that it would fall to the \n",
      "sound of trumpets only. Therefore coming at length to \n",
      "Hithlum he made his first camp and dwelling by the northern \n",
      "shores of Lake Mithrim. No love was there in the hearts of \n",
      "those that followed Fingolfin for the House of Feanor, for \n",
      "the agony of those that endured the crossing of the Ice had \n",
      "been great, and Fingolfin held the sons the accomplices of \n",
      "their father. Then there was peril of strife between the hosts; \n",
      "but grievous as were their losses upon the road, the people \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "of Fingolfin and of Finrod son of Finarfin were still more \n",
      "numerous than the followers of Feanor, and these now \n",
      "withdrew before them, and removed their dwelling to the \n",
      "southern shore; and the lake lay between them. Many of \n",
      "Feanor's people indeed repented of the burning at Losgar, \n",
      "and were filled with amazement at the valour that had \n",
      "brought the friends whom they had abandoned over the Ice \n",
      "of the North; and they would have welcomed them, but they \n",
      "dared not, for shame. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus because of the curse that lay upon them the \n",
      "Noldor achieved nothing, while Morgoth hesitated, and the \n",
      "dread of light was new and strong upon the Ores. But \n",
      "Morgoth arose from thought, and seeing the division of his \n",
      "foes he laughed. In the pits of Angband he caused vast \n",
      "smokes and vapours to be made, and they came forth from \n",
      "the reeking tops of the Iron Mountains, and afar off they \n",
      "could be seen in Mithrim, staining the bright airs in the first \n",
      "mornings of the world. A wind came out of the east, and \n",
      "bore them over Hithlum, darkening the new Sun; and they \n",
      "fell, and coiled about the fields and hollows, and lay upon \n",
      "the waters of Mithrim, drear and poisonous. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Fingon the valiant, son of Fingolfin, resolved to \n",
      "heal the feud that divided the Noldor, before their Enemy \n",
      "should be ready for war; for the earth trembled in the \n",
      "Northlands with the thunder of the forges of Morgoth \n",
      "underground. Long before, in the bliss of Valinor, before \n",
      "Melkor was unchained, or lies came between them, Fingon \n",
      "had been close in friendship with Maedhros; and though he \n",
      "knew not yet that Maedhros had not forgotten him at the \n",
      "burning of the ships, the thought of their ancient friendship \n",
      "stung his heart. Therefore he dared a deed which is Justly \n",
      "renowned among the feats of the princes of the Noldor: \n",
      "alone, and without the counsel of any, he set forth in search \n",
      "of Maedhros; and aided by the very darkness that Morgoth \n",
      "had made he came unseen into the fastness of his foes. \n",
      "High upon the shoulders of Thangorodrim he climbed, and \n",
      "looked in despair upon the desolation of the land; but no \n",
      "passage or crevice could he find through which he might \n",
      "come within Morgoth's stronghold. Then in defiance of the \n",
      "Ores, who cowered still in the dark vaults beneath the earth, \n",
      "he took his harp and sang a song of Valinor that the Noldor \n",
      "made of old, before strife was born among the sons of \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Finwe; and his voice rang in the mournful hollows that had \n",
      "never heard before aught save cries of fear and woe. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus Fingon found what he sought. For suddenly \n",
      "above him far and faint his song was taken up, and a voice \n",
      "answering called to him. Maedhros it was that sang amid \n",
      "his torment. But Fingon climbed to the foot of the precipice \n",
      "where his kinsman hung, and then could go no further; and \n",
      "he wept when he saw the cruel device of Morgoth. \n",
      "Maedhros therefore, being in anguish without hope, \n",
      "begged Fingon to shoot him with his bow; and Fingon \n",
      "strung an arrow, and bent his bow. And seeing no better \n",
      "hope he cried to Manwe, saying: 'O King to whom all birds \n",
      "are dear, speed now this feathered shaft, and recall some \n",
      "pity for the Noldor in their need!' \n",
      "\n",
      "His prayer was answered swiftly. For Manwe to whom \n",
      "all birds are dear, and to whom they bring news upon \n",
      "Taniquetil from Middle-earth, had sent forth the race of \n",
      "Eagles, commanding them to dwell in the crags of the \n",
      "North, and to keep watch upon Morgoth; for Manwe still had \n",
      "pity for the exiled Elves. And the Eagles brought news of \n",
      "much that passed in those days to the sad ears of Manwe. \n",
      "Now, even as Fingon bent his bow, there flew down from \n",
      "the high airs Thorondor, King of Eagles, mightiest of all \n",
      "birds that have ever been, whose outstretched wings \n",
      "spanned thirty fathoms; and staying Fingon's hand he took \n",
      "him up, and bore him to the face of the rock where \n",
      "Maedhros hung. But Fingon could not release the hell- \n",
      "wrought bond upon his wrist, nor sever it, nor draw it from \n",
      "the stone. Again therefore in his pain Maedhros begged \n",
      "that he would slay him; but Fingon cut off his hand above \n",
      "the wrist, and Thorondor bore them back to Mithrim. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There Maedhros in time was healed; for the fire of life \n",
      "was hot within him, and his strength was of the ancient \n",
      "world, such as those possessed who were nurtured in \n",
      "Valinor. His body recovered from his torment and became \n",
      "hale, but the shadow of his pain was in his heart; and he \n",
      "lived to wield his sword with left hand more deadly than his \n",
      "right had been. By this deed Fingon won great renown, and \n",
      "all the Noldor praised him; and the hatred between the \n",
      "houses of Fingolfin and Feanor was assuaged. For \n",
      "Maedhros begged forgiveness for the desertion in Araman; \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "and he waived his claim to kingship over all the Noldor, \n",
      "saying to Fingolfin: 'If there lay no grievance between us, \n",
      "lord, still the kingship would rightly come to you, the eldest \n",
      "here of the house of Finwe, and not the least wise.' But to \n",
      "this his brothers did not all in their hearts agree. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore even as Mandos foretold the House of \n",
      "Feanor were called the Dispossessed, because the over- \n",
      "lordship passed from it, the elder, to the house of Fingolfin, \n",
      "both in Elende and in Beleriand, and because also of the \n",
      "loss of the Silmarils. But the Noldor being again united set \n",
      "a watch upon the borders of Dor Daedeloth, and Angband \n",
      "was beleaguered from west, and south, and east; and they \n",
      "sent forth messengers far and wide to explore the countries \n",
      "of Beleriand, and to treat with the people that dwelt there. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now King Thingol welcomed not with a full heart the \n",
      "coming of so many princes in might out of the West, eager \n",
      "for new realms; and he would not open his kingdom, nor \n",
      "remove its girdle of enchantment, for wise with the wisdom \n",
      "of Melian he trusted not that the restraint of Morgoth would \n",
      "endure. Alone of the princes of the Noldor those of \n",
      "Finarfin's house were suffered to pass within the confines \n",
      "of Doriath; for they could claim close kinship with King \n",
      "Thingol himself, since their mother was Earwen of \n",
      "Alqualonde, Olwe's daughter. \n",
      "\n",
      "Angrod son of Finarfin was the first of the Exiles to \n",
      "come to Menegroth, as messenger of his brother Finrod, \n",
      "and he spoke long with the King, telling him of the deeds of \n",
      "the Noldor in the north, and of their numbers, and of the \n",
      "ordering of their force; but being true, and wisehearted, and \n",
      "thinking all griefs now forgiven, he spoke no word \n",
      "concerning the kinslaying, nor of the manner of the exile of \n",
      "the Noldor and the oath of Feanor. King Thingol hearkened \n",
      "to the words of Angrod; and ere he went he said to him; \n",
      "Thus shall you speak for me to those that sent you. In \n",
      "Hithlum the Noldor have leave to dwell, and in the highlands \n",
      "of Dorthonion, and in the lands east of Doriath that are \n",
      "empty and wild; but elsewhere there are many of my \n",
      "people, and I would not have them restrained of their \n",
      "freedom, still less ousted from their homes. Beware \n",
      "therefore how you princes of the West bear yourselves; for I \n",
      "am the Lord of Beleriand, and all who seek to dwell there \n",
      "shall hear my word. Into Doriath none shall come to abide \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "but only such as I call as guests, or who seek me in great \n",
      "need.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Now the lords of the Noldor held council in Mithrim, and \n",
      "thither came Angrod out of Doriath, bearing the message \n",
      "of King Thingol. Cold seemed its welcome to the Noldor, \n",
      "and the sons of Feanor were angered at the words; but \n",
      "Maedhros laughed, saying: 'A king is he that can hold his \n",
      "own, or else his title is vain. Thingol does but grant us lands \n",
      "where his power does not run. Indeed Doriath alone would \n",
      "be his realm this day, but for the coming of the Noldor. \n",
      "Therefore in Doriath let him reign, and be glad that he has \n",
      "the sons of Finwe for his neighbours, not the Ores of \n",
      "Morgoth that we found. Elsewhere it shall go as seems \n",
      "good to us.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "But Caranthir, who loved not the sons of Finarfin, and \n",
      "was the harshest of the brothers and the most quick to \n",
      "anger, cried aloud: 'Yea more! Let not the sons of Finarfin \n",
      "run hither and thither with their tales to this Dark Elf in his \n",
      "caves! Who made them our spokesmen to deal with him? \n",
      "And though they be come indeed to Beleriand, let them not \n",
      "so swiftly forget that their father is a lord of the Noldor, \n",
      "though their mother be of other kin.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Angrod was wrathful and went forth from the \n",
      "council. Maedhros indeed rebuked Caranthir; but the \n",
      "greater part of the Noldor, of both followings, hearing his \n",
      "words were troubled in heart, fearing the fell spirit of the \n",
      "sons of Feanor that it seemed would ever be like to burst \n",
      "forth in rash word or violence. But Maedhros restrained his \n",
      "brothers, and they departed from the council, and soon \n",
      "afterwards they left Mithrim and went eastward beyond \n",
      "Arcs to the wide lands about the Hill of Himring. That region \n",
      "was named thereafter the March of Maedhros; for \n",
      "northwards there was little defence of hill or river against \n",
      "assault from Angband. There Maedhros and his brothers \n",
      "kept watch, gathering all such people as would come to \n",
      "them, and they had few dealings with their kinsfolk \n",
      "westward, save at need. It is said indeed that Maedhros \n",
      "himself devised this plan, to lessen the chances of strife, \n",
      "and because he was very willing that the chief peril of \n",
      "assault should fall upon himself; and he remained for his \n",
      "part in friendship with the houses of Fingolfin and Finarfin, \n",
      "and would come among them at times for common \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "counsel. Yet he also was bound by the oath, though it slept \n",
      "now for a time. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now the people of Caranthir dwelt furthest east beyond \n",
      "the upper waters of Gelion, about Lake Helevorn under \n",
      "Mount Rerir and to the southward; and they climbed the \n",
      "heights of Ered Luin and looked eastward in wonder, for \n",
      "wild and wide it seemed to them were the lands of Middle- \n",
      "earth. And thus it was that Caranthir's people came upon \n",
      "the Dwarves, who after the onslaught of Morgoth and the \n",
      "coming of the Noldor had ceased their traffic into \n",
      "Beleriand. But though either people loved skill and were \n",
      "eager to learn, no great love was there between them; for \n",
      "the Dwarves were secret and quick to resentment, and \n",
      "Caranthir was haughty and scarce concealed his scorn for \n",
      "the unloveliness of the Naugrim, and his people followed \n",
      "their lord. Nevertheless since both peoples feared and \n",
      "hated Morgoth they made alliance, and had of it great \n",
      "profit; for the Naugrim learned many secrets of craft in \n",
      "those days, so that the smiths and masons of Nogrod and \n",
      "Belegost became renowned among their kin, and when the \n",
      "Dwarves began again to journey into Beleriand all the traffic \n",
      "of the dwarf-mines passed first through the hands of \n",
      "Caranthir, and thus great riches came to him. \n",
      "\n",
      "When twenty years of the Sun had passed, Fingolfin \n",
      "King of the Noldor made a great feast; and it was held in \n",
      "the spring near to the pools of Ivrin, whence the swift river \n",
      "Narog rose, for there the lands were green and fair at the \n",
      "feet of the Mountains of Shadow that shielded them from \n",
      "the north. The joy of that feast was long remembered in \n",
      "later days of sorrow; and it was called Mereth Aderthad, the \n",
      "Feast of Reuniting. Thither came many of the chieftains and \n",
      "people of Fingolfin and Finrod; and of the sons of Feanor \n",
      "Maedhros and Maglor, with warriors of the eastern March; \n",
      "and there came also great numbers of the Grey-elves, \n",
      "wanderers of the woods of Beleriand and folk of the \n",
      "Havens, with Cirdan their lord. There came even Green- \n",
      "elves from Ossiriand, the Land of Seven Rivers, far off \n",
      "under the walls of the Blue Mountains; but out of Doriath \n",
      "there came but two messengers, Mablung and Daeron, \n",
      "bearing greetings from the King. \n",
      "\n",
      "At Mereth Aderthad many counsels were taken in \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "good will, and oaths were sworn of league and friendship; \n",
      "and it is told that at this feast the tongue of the Grey-elves \n",
      "was most spoken even by the Noldor, for they learned \n",
      "swiftly the speech of Beleriand, whereas the Sindar were \n",
      "slow to master the tongue of Valinor. The hearts of the \n",
      "Noldor were high and full of hope, and to many among them \n",
      "it seemed that the words of Feanor had been justified, \n",
      "bidding them seek freedom and fair kingdoms in Middle- \n",
      "earth; and indeed there followed after long years of peace, \n",
      "while their swords fenced Beleriand from the ruin of \n",
      "Morgoth, and his power was shut behind his gates. In those \n",
      "days there was joy beneath the new Sun and Moon, and all \n",
      "the land was glad; but still the Shadow brooded in the north. \n",
      "\n",
      "And when again thirty years had passed, Turgon son \n",
      "of Fingolfin left Nevrast where he dwelt and sought out \n",
      "Finrod his friend upon the island of Tol Sirion, and they \n",
      "journeyed southward along the river, being weary for a \n",
      "while of the northern mountains; and as they journeyed night \n",
      "came upon them beyond the Meres of Twilight beside the \n",
      "waters of Sirion, and they slept upon his banks beneath the \n",
      "summer stars. But Ulmo coming up the river laid a deep \n",
      "sleep upon them and heavy dreams; and the trouble of the \n",
      "dreams remained after they awoke, but neither said aught \n",
      "to the other, for their memory was not clear, and each \n",
      "believed that Ulmo had sent a message to him alone. But \n",
      "unquiet was upon them ever after, and doubt of what should \n",
      "befall, and they wandered often alone in untrodden lands, \n",
      "seeking far and wide for places of hidden strength; for it \n",
      "seemed to each that he was bidden to prepare for a day of \n",
      "evil, and to establish a retreat, lest Morgoth should burst \n",
      "from Angband and overthrow the armies of the North. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now on a time Finrod and Galadriel his sister were the \n",
      "guests of Thingol their kinsman in Doriath. Then Finrod was \n",
      "filled with wonder at the strength and majesty of Menegroth, \n",
      "its treasuries and armouries and its many-pillared halls of \n",
      "stone; and it came into his heart that he would build wide \n",
      "halls behind ever-guarded gates in some deep and secret \n",
      "place beneath the hills. Therefore he opened his heart to \n",
      "Thingol, telling him of his dreams; and Thingol spoke to him \n",
      "of the deep gorge of the River Narog, and the caves under \n",
      "the High Faroth in its steep western shore, and when he \n",
      "departed he gave him guides to lead him to that place of \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "which few yet knew. Thus Finrod came to the Caverns of \n",
      "Narog, and began to establish there deep halls and \n",
      "armouries after the fashion of the mansions of Menegroth; \n",
      "and that stronghold was called Nargothrond. In that labour \n",
      "Finrod was aided by the Dwarves of the Blue Mountains; \n",
      "and they were rewarded well, for Finrod had brought more \n",
      "treasures out of Tlrion than any other of the princes of the \n",
      "Noldor. And in that time was made for him the Nauglamir, \n",
      "the Necklace of the Dwarves, most renowned of their works \n",
      "in the Elder Days. It was a carcanet of gold, and set therein \n",
      "were gems uncounted from Valinor; but it had a power \n",
      "within it so that it rested lightly on its wearer as a strand of \n",
      "flax, and whatsoever neck it clasped it sat always with \n",
      "grace and loveliness. \n",
      "\n",
      "There in Nargothrond Finrod made his home with \n",
      "many of his people, and he was named in the tongue of the \n",
      "Dwarves Felagund, Hewer of Caves; and that name he \n",
      "bore thereafter until his end. But Finrod Felagund was not \n",
      "the first to dwell in the caves beside the River Narog. \n",
      "\n",
      "Galadriel his sister went not with him to Nargothrond, \n",
      "for in Doriath dwelt Celeborn, kinsman of Thingol, and there \n",
      "was great love between them. Therefore she remained in \n",
      "the Hidden Kingdom, and abode with Melian, and of her \n",
      "learned great lore and wisdom concerning Middle-earth. \n",
      "\n",
      "But Turgon remembered the city set upon a hill, Tlrion \n",
      "the fair with its tower and tree, and he found not what he \n",
      "sought, but returned to Nevrast, and sat in peace in \n",
      "Vinyamar by the shores of the sea. And in the next year \n",
      "Ulmo himself appeared to him, and bade him go forth \n",
      "again alone into the Vale of Sirion; and Turgon went forth, \n",
      "and by the guidance of Ulmo he discovered the hidden vale \n",
      "of Tumladen in the Encircling Mountains, in the midst of \n",
      "which there was a hill of stone. Of this he spoke to none as \n",
      "yet, but returned once more to Nevrast, and there began in \n",
      "his secret counsels to devise the plan of a city after the \n",
      "manner of Tlrion upon Tuna, for which his heart yearned in \n",
      "exile. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now Morgoth, believing the report of his spies that the \n",
      "lords of the Noldor were wandering abroad with little \n",
      "thought of war, made trial of the strength and watchfulness \n",
      "of his enemies. Once more, with little warning, his might \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "was stirred, and suddenly there were earthquakes in the \n",
      "north, and fire came from fissures in the earth, and the Iron \n",
      "Mountains vomited flame; and Ores poured forth across the \n",
      "plain of Ard-galen. Thence they thrust down the Pass of \n",
      "Sirion in the west, and in the east they burst through the \n",
      "land of Maglor, in the gap between the hills of Maedhros \n",
      "and the outliers of the Blue Mountains. But Fingolfin and \n",
      "Maedhros were not sleeping, and while others sought out \n",
      "the scattered bands of Ores that strayed in Beleriand did \n",
      "great evil they came upon the main host from either side as \n",
      "it was assaulting Dorthonion; and they defeated the \n",
      "servants of Morgoth, and pursuing them across Ard-galen \n",
      "destroyed them utterly, to the least and last, within sight of \n",
      "Angband's gates. That was the third great battle of the \n",
      "Wars of Beleriand, and it was named Dagor Aglareb, the \n",
      "Glorious Battle. \n",
      "\n",
      "A victory it was, and yet a warning; and the princes \n",
      "took heed of it, and thereafter drew closer their leaguer, \n",
      "and strengthened and ordered their watch, setting the \n",
      "Siege of Angband. which lasted wellnigh four hundred \n",
      "years of the Sun. For a long time after Dagor Aglareb no \n",
      "servant of Morgoth would venture from his gates, for they \n",
      "feared the lords of the Noldor; and Fingolfin boasted that \n",
      "save by treason among themselves Morgoth could never \n",
      "again burst from the leaguer of the Eldar, nor come upon \n",
      "them at unawares. Yet the Noldor could not capture \n",
      "Angband, nor could they regain the Silmarils; and war never \n",
      "wholly ceased in all that time of the Siege, for Morgoth \n",
      "devised new evils, and ever and anon he would make trial \n",
      "of his enemies. Nor could the stronghold of Morgoth be \n",
      "ever wholly encircled: for the Iron Mountains, from whose \n",
      "great curving wall the towers of Thangorodrim were thrust \n",
      "forward, defended it upon either side, and were \n",
      "impassable to the Noldor, because of their snow and ice. \n",
      "Thus in his rear and to the north Morgoth had no foes, and \n",
      "by that way his spies at times went out, and came by \n",
      "devious routes into Beleriand. And desiring above all to \n",
      "sow fear and disunion among the Eldar, he commanded \n",
      "the Ores to take alive any of them that they could and bring \n",
      "them bound to Angband; and some he so daunted by the \n",
      "terror of his eyes that they needed no chains more, but \n",
      "walked ever in fear of him, doing his will wherever they \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "might be. Thus Morgoth learned much of all that had \n",
      "befallen since the rebellion of Feanor, and he rejoiced, \n",
      "seeing therein the seed of many dissensions among his \n",
      "foes. \n",
      "\n",
      "When nearly one hundred years had run since the \n",
      "Dagor Aglareb, Morgoth endeavoured to take Fingolfin at \n",
      "unawares (for he knew of the vigilance of Maedhros); and \n",
      "he sent forth an army into the white north, and they turned \n",
      "west and again south and came down the coasts to the \n",
      "Firth of Drengist, by the route that Fingolfin followed from \n",
      "the Grinding Ice. Thus they would enter into the realm of \n",
      "Hithlum from the west; but they were espied in time, and \n",
      "Fingon fell upon them among the hills at the head of the \n",
      "Firth, and most of the Ores were driven into the sea. This \n",
      "was not reckoned among the great battles, for the Ores \n",
      "were not in great number, and only a part of the people of \n",
      "Hithlum fought there. But thereafter there was peace for \n",
      "many years, and no open assault from Angband, for \n",
      "Morgoth perceived now that the Ores unaided were no \n",
      "match for the Noldor; and he sought in his heart for new \n",
      "counsel. \n",
      "\n",
      "Again after a hundred years Glaurung, the first of the \n",
      "Uruloki, the fire-drakes of the North, issued from Angband's \n",
      "gates by night. He was yet young and scarce half-grown, for \n",
      "long and slow is the life of the dragons, but the Elves fled \n",
      "before him to Ered Wethrin and Dorthonion in dismay; and \n",
      "he defiled the fields of Ard-galen. Then Fingon prince of \n",
      "Hithlum rode against him with archers on horseback, and \n",
      "hemmed him round with a ring of swift riders; and Glaurung \n",
      "could not endure their darts, being not yet come to his full \n",
      "armoury, and he fled back to Angband, and came not forth \n",
      "again for many years. Fingon won great praise, and the \n",

      "vale of Gelion sloped steadily southward, and Gelion had \n",
      "neither fall nor rapids throughout his course, but was ever \n",
      "swifter than was Sirion. Between Ramdal and Gelion there \n",
      "stood a single hill of great extent and gentle slopes, but \n",

      "It has been told how by the guidance of Ulmo Turgon of \n",
      "Nevrast discovered the hidden vale of Tumladen; and that \n",
      "(as was after known) lay east of the upper waters of Sirion, \n",
      "in a ring of mountains tall and sheer, and no living thing \n",
      "came there save the eagles of Thorondor. But there was a \n",
      "deep way under the mountains delved in the darkness of \n",
      "the world by waters that flowed out to join the streams of \n",
      "Sirion; and this way Turgon found, and so came to the \n",
      "green plain amid the mountains, and saw the island-hill that \n",
      "stood there of hard smooth stone; for the vale had been a \n",
      "great lake in ancient days. Then Turgon knew that he had \n",
      "found the place of his desire, and he resolved to build there \n",
      "a fair city, a memorial of Tirion upon Tuna; but he returned \n",
      "to Nevrast, and remained there in peace, though he \n",
      "pondered ever in his thought how he should accomplish his \n",
      "design. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now after the Dagor Aglareb the unquiet that Ulmo set \n",
      "in his heart returned to him, and he summoned many of the \n",
      "hardiest and most skilled of his people, and led them \n",
      "secretly to the hidden vale, and there they began the \n",
      "building of the city that Turgon had devised; and they set a \n",
      "watch all about it, that none might come upon their work \n",
      "from without, and the power of Ulmo that ran in Sirion \n",
      "protected them. But Turgon dwelt still for the most part in \n",
      "Nevrast, until it came to pass that at last the city was full- \n",
      "wrought, after two and fifty years of secret toil. It is said that \n",
      "Turgon appointed its name to be Ondolinde in the speech \n",
      "of the Elves of Valinor, the Rock of the Music of Water, for \n",
      "there were fountains upon the hill; but in the Sindarin tongue \n",
      "the name was changed, and it became Gondolin, the \n",
      "Hidden Rock. Then Turgon prepared to depart from \n",
      "Nevrast and leave his halls in Vinyamar beside the sea; \n",
      "and there Ulmo came to him once again, and spoke with \n",
      "him. And he said: 'Now thou shalt go at last to Gondolin, \n",
      "Turgon; and I will maintain my power in the Vale of Sirion, \n",
      "and in all the waters therein, so that none shall mark thy \n",
      "going, nor shall any find there the hidden entrance against \n",
      "thy will. Longest of all the realms of the Eldalie shall \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Gondolin stand against Melkor. But love not too well the \n",

      "remember that the true hope of the Noldor lieth in the West \n",
      "and cometh from the Sea.' \n",
      "\n",
      "And Ulmo warned Turgon that he also lay under the \n",
      "Doom of Mandos, which Ulmo had no power to remove. \n",
      "Thus it may come to pass,' he said, 'that the curse of the \n",
      "Noldor shall find thee too ere the end, and treason awake \n",
      "within thy walls. Then they shall be in peril of fire. But if this \n",
      "peril draweth nigh indeed, then even from Nevrast one shall \n",
      "come to warn thee, and from him beyond ruin and fire hope \n",
      "shall be bom for Elves and Men. Leave therefore in this \n",
      "house arms and a sword, that in years to come he may find \n",
      "them, and thus shalt thou know him, and not be deceived.' \n",
      "And Ulmo declared to Turgon of what kind and stature \n",

      "Fingolfin's following, and a yet greater host of the Sindar; \n",
      "and they passed away, company by company, secretly, \n",
      "under the shadows of Ered Wethrin, and they came unseen \n",
      "to Gondolin, and none knew whither they had gone. And \n",
      "last of all Turgon arose, and went with his household silently \n",
      "through the hills, and passed the gates in the mountains, \n",
      "and they were shut behind him. \n",
      "\n",
      "Through many long years none passed inward \n",
      "thereafter, save Hurin and Huor only; and the host of Turgon \n",
      "came never forth again until the Year of Lamentation after \n",
      "three hundred and fifty years and more. But behind the \n",
      "circle of the mountains the people of Turgon grew and \n",
      "throve, and they put forth their skill in labour unceasing, so \n",
      "that Gondolin upon Amon Gwareth became fair indeed and \n",
      "fit to compare even with Elven \"Hrion beyond the sea. High \n",
      "and white were its walls, and smooth its stairs, and tall and \n",
      "strong was the Tower of the King. There shining fountains \n",
      "played, and in the courts of Turgon stood images of the \n",
      "Trees of old, which Turgon himself wrought with elven-craft; \n",
      "and the Tree which he made of gold was named Glingal, \n",

      "Now while the city of Gondolin was building in secret, \n",
      "Finrod Felagund wrought in the deep places of \n",

      "told, in Thingol's realm in Doriath. And at times Melian and \n",
      "Galadriel would speak together of Valinor and the bliss of \n",
      "old; but beyond the dark hour of the death of the Trees \n",
      "Galadriel would not go, but ever fell silent. And on a time \n",
      "Melian said: There is some woe that lies upon you and \n",
      "your kin. That I can see in you, but all else is hidden from \n",
      "me; for by no vision or thought can I perceive anything that \n",
      "passed or passes in the West: a shadow lies over all the \n",
      "land of Aman, and reaches far out over the sea. Why will \n",
      "you not tell me more?' \n",
      "\n",
      "'For that woe is past,' said Galadriel; 'and I would take \n",

      "there is woe enough yet to come, though still hope may \n",
      "seem bright.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Melian looked in her eyes, and said: 'I believe not \n",
      "that the Noldor came forth as messengers of the Valar, as \n",
      "was said at first: not though they came in the very hour of \n",
      "our need. For they speak never of the Valar, nor have their \n",
      "high lords brought any message to Thingol, whether from \n",
      "Manwe, or Ulmo, or even from Olwe the King's brother, and \n",
      "his own folk that went over the sea. For what cause, \n",
      "Galadriel, were the high people of the Noldor driven forth as \n",
      "exiles from Aman? Or what evil lies on the sons of Feanor \n",
      "that they are so haughty and so fell? Do I not strike near the \n",
      "truth?' \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Near,' said Galadriel; 'save that we were not driven \n",
      "forth, but came of our own will, and against that of the Valar. \n",
      "And through great peril and in despite of the Valar for this \n",
      "purpose we came: to take vengeance upon Morgoth, and \n",
      "regain what he stole.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Galadriel spoke to Melian of the Silmarils, and of \n",
      "the slaying of King Finwe at Formenos: but still she said no \n",
      "word of the Oath, nor of the Kinslaying, nor of the burning of \n",
      "the ships at Losgar. But Melian said: 'Now much you tell \n",
      "me, and yet more I perceive. A darkness you would cast \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "over the long road from Trion, but I see evil there, which \n",
      "Thingol should learn for his guidance.' \n",
      "\n",
      "'Maybe,' said Galadriel; 'but not of me.' \n",
      "\n",
      "And Melian spoke then no more of these matters with \n",
      "Galadriel; but she told to King Thingol all that she had heard \n",
      "of the Silmarils. 'This is a great matter,' she said, 'greater \n",
      "indeed than the Noldor themselves understand; for the Light \n",
      "of Aman and the fate of Arda lie locked now in these things, \n",
      "the work of Feanor, who is gone. They shall not be \n",
      "recovered, I foretell, by any power of the Eldar; and the \n",
      "world shall be broken in battles that are to come, ere they \n",
      "are wrested from Morgoth. See now! Feanor they have \n",
      "slain, and many another, as I guess; but first of all the \n",
      "deaths they have brought and yet shall bring was Finwe \n",
      "your friend. Morgoth slew him, ere he fled from Aman.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Thingol was silent, being filled with grief and \n",
      "foreboding; but at length he said: 'Now at last I understand \n",
      "the coming of the Noldor out of the West, at which I \n",
      "wondered much before. Not to our aid did they come (save \n",
      "by chance); for those that remain in Middle-earth the Valar \n",
      "will leave to their own devices, until the uttermost need. For \n",
      "vengeance and redress of their loss the Noldor came. Yet \n",
      "all the more sure shall they be as allies against Morgoth, \n",
      "with whom it is not now to be thought that they shall ever \n",
      "make treaty.' \n",
      "\n",
      "But Melian said; 'Truly for these causes they came; but \n",
      "for others also. Beware of the sons of Feanor! The shadow \n",
      "of the wrath of the Valar lies upon them; and they have done \n",
      "evil, I perceive, both in Aman and to their own kin. A grief \n",
      "but lulled to sleep lies between the princes of the Noldor.' \n",
      "\n",
      "And Thingol answered: 'What is that to me? Of Feanor \n",
      "I have heard but report, which makes him great indeed. Of \n",
      "his sons I hear little to my pleasure; yet they are likely to \n",
      "prove the deadliest foes of our foe.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Their swords and their counsels shall have two edges,' \n",
      "I said Melian; and afterwards they spoke no more of this \n",
      "matter. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was not long before whispered tales began to pass \n",
      "among the Sindar concerning the deeds of the Noldor ere \n",
      "they came to Beleriand. Certain it is whence they came, \n",
      "and the evil truth was enhanced and poisoned by lies; but \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the Sindar were yet unwary and trustful of words, and (as \n",
      "may well be thought) Morgoth chose them for this first \n",
      "assault of his malice, for they knew him not. And Cirdan, \n",
      "hearing these dark tales, was troubled; for he was wise, \n",
      "and perceived swiftly that true or false they were put about \n",
      "at this time through malice, though the malice he deemed \n",
      "was that of the princes of the Noldor, because of the \n",
      "jealousy of their houses. Therefore he sent messengers to \n",
      "Thingol to tell all that he had heard. \n",
      "\n",
      "It chanced that at that time the sons of Finarfin were \n",
      "again the guests of Thingol, for they wished to see their \n",
      "sister Galadriel. Then Thingol, being greatly moved, spoke \n",
      "in anger to Finrod, saying: 'III have you done to me, \n",
      "kinsman, to conceal so great matters from me. For now I \n",
      "have learned of all the evil deeds of the Noldor.' \n",
      "\n",
      "But Finrod answered: 'What ill have I done yon, lord? \n",
      "Or what evil deed have the Noldor done in all your realm to \n",
      "grieve you? Neither against your kinship nor against any of \n",
      "your people have they thought evil or done evil.' \n",
      "\n",
      "'I marvel at you, son of Earwen,' said Thingol, 'that you \n",
      "would come to the board of your kinsman thus red-handed \n",
      "from the slaying of your mothers kin, and yet say naught in \n",
      "defence, nor yet seek any pardon!' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Finrod was greatly troubled, but he was silent, for \n",
      "he could not defend himself, save by bringing charges \n",
      "against the other princes of the Noldor; and that he was \n",
      "loath to do before Thingol. But in Angrod's heart the \n",
      "memory of the words of Caranthir welled up again in \n",
      "bitterness, and he cried: 'Lord, I know not what lies you \n",
      "have heard, nor whence; but we came not red-handed. \n",
      "Guiltless we came forth, save maybe of folly, to listen to the \n",
      "words of fell Feanor, and become as if besotted with wine, \n",
      "and as briefly. No evil did we do on our road, but suffered \n",
      "ourselves great wrong; and forgave it. For this we are \n",
      "named tale-bearers to you and treasonable to the Noldor: \n",
      "untruly as you know, for we have of our loyalty been silent \n",
      "before you, and thus earned your anger. But now these \n",
      "charges are no longer to be borne, and the truth yon shall \n",
      "know.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Angrod spoke bitterly against the sons of \n",
      "Feanor, telling of the blood at Alqualonde, and the Doom of \n",
      "Mandos, and the burning of the ships at Losgar. And he \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "cried: 'Wherefore should we that endured the Grinding Ice \n",
      "bear the name of kinslayers and traitors?' \n",
      "\n",
      "'Yet the shadow of Mandos lies on you also,' said \n",
      "Melian. ButThingol was long silent ere he spoke. 'Go now!' \n",
      "he said. 'For my heart is hot within me. Later you may \n",
      "return, if you will; for I will not shut my doors for ever against \n",
      "you, my kindred, that were ensnared in an evil that you did \n",
      "not aid. With Fingolfin and his people also I will keep \n",
      "friendship, for they have bitterly atoned for such ill as they \n",
      "did. And in our hatred of the Power that wrought all this woe \n",
      "our griefs shall be lost. But hear my words! Never again in \n",
      "my ears shall be heard the tongue of those who slew my kin \n",
      "inAlqualonde! Nor in all my realm shall it be openly spoken, \n",
      "while my power endures. All the Sindar shall hear my \n",
      "command that they shall neither speak with the tongue of \n",
      "the Noldor nor answer to it. And all such as use it shall be \n",
      "held slayers of kin and betrayers of kin unrepentant.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the sons of Finarfin departed from Menegroth \n",
      "with heavy hearts, perceiving how the words of Mandos \n",
      "would ever be made true, and that none of the Noldor that \n",
      "followed after Feanor could escape from the shadow that \n",
      "lay upon his house. And it came to pass even as Thingol \n",
      "had spoken; for the Sindar heard his word, and thereafter \n",
      "throughout Beleriand they refused the tongue of the Noldor, \n",
      "and shunned those that spoke it aloud; but the Exiles took \n",
      "the Sindarin tongue in all their daily uses, and the High \n",
      "Speech of the West was spoken only by the lords of the \n",

      "It came to pass that Nargothrond was full-wrought (and \n",

      "came from Doriath and dwelt a while in Nargothrond. Now \n",
      "King Finrod Felagund had no wife, and Galadriel asked \n",
      "him why this should be; but foresight came upon Felagund \n",

      "she wearied of the guarded city of Gondolin, desiring ever \n",

      "walk in the forests, as had been her wont in Valinor: and \n",
      "when two hundred years had passed since Gondolin was \n",
      "full-wrought, she spoke to Turgon and asked leave to \n",
      "depart. Turgon was loath to grant this, and long denied her; \n",
      "but at the last he yielded, saying: 'Go then, if you will though \n",

      "Aredhel: To the land of Celegorm for which you seek, Lady, \n",
      "you may by no means pass through the realm of King \n",
      "Thingol; you must ride beyond the Girdle of Melian, to the \n",
      "south or to the north. The speediest way is by the paths that \n",
      "lead east from the Brithiach through Dimbar and along the \n",
      "north-march of this kingdom, until you pass the Bridge of \n",
      "Esgalduin and the Fords of Aros, and come to the lands \n",
      "that lie behind the Hill of Himring. There dwell, as we \n",
      "believe, Celegorm and Curufin, and it may be that you will \n",
      "find them; but the road is perilous.' \n",

      "Then Aredhel turned back and sought the dangerous \n",
      "road between the haunted valleys of Ered Gorgoroth and \n",
      "the north fences of Doriath; and as they drew near to the \n",
      "evil region of Nan Dungortheb the riders became \n",
      "enmeshed in shadows, and Aredhel strayed from her \n",
      "companions and was lost. They sought long for her in vain, \n",
      "fearing that she had been ensnared, or had drunk from the \n",
      "poisoned streams of that land; but the fell creatures of \n",
      "Ungoliant that dwelt in the ravines were aroused and \n",
      "pursued them, and they hardly escaped with their lives. \n",
      "When at last they returned and their tale was told there was \n",
      "great sorrow in Gondolin; and Turgon sat long alone, \n",
      "enduring grief and anger in silence. \n",
      "\n",
      "But Aredhel, having sought in vain for her companions, \n",

      "crossing Esgalduin and Aros came to the land of Himlad \n",
      "between Aros and Celon where Celegorm and Curufin \n",
      "dwelt in those days, before the breaking of the Siege of \n",
      "Angband. At that time they were from home, riding with \n",
      "Caranthir east in Thargelion; but the people of Celegorm \n",
      "welcomed her and bade her stay among them with honour \n",
      "until their lord's return. There for a while she was content, \n",
      "and had great Joy in wandering free in the woodlands; but \n",
      "as the year lengthened and Celegorm did not return, she \n",
      "became restless again, and took to riding alone ever \n",
      "further abroad, seeking for new paths and untrodden \n",
      "glades. Thus it chanced in the waning of the year that \n",
      "Aredhel came to the south of Himlad, and passed over \n",
      "Celon; and before she was aware she was enmeshed in \n",
      "Nan Elmoth. \n",

      "In that wood in ages past Melian walked in the twilight \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "of Middle-earth when the trees were young, and \n",
      "enchantment lay upon it still. But now the trees of Nan \n",
      "Elmoth were the tallest and darkest in all Beleriand, and \n",
      "there the sun never came; and there Eol dwelt, who was \n",
      "named the Dark Elf. Of old he was of the kin of Thingol, but \n",
      "he was restless and ill at ease in Doriath, and when the \n",
      "Girdle of Melian was set about the Forest of Region where \n",
      "he dwelt he fled thence to Nan Elmoth. There he lived in \n",
      "deep shadow, loving the night and the twilight under the \n",
      "stars. He shunned the Noldor, holding them to blame for the \n",
      "return of Morgoth, to trouble the quiet of Beleriand; but for \n",
      "the Dwarves he had more liking than any other of the \n",
      "Elvenfolk of old. From him the Dwarves learned much of \n",
      "what passed in the lands of the Eldar. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now the traffic of the Dwarves down from the Blue \n",
      "Mountains followed two roads across East Beleriand, and \n",
      "the northern way, going towards the Fords of Aros, passed \n",
      "nigh to Nan Elmoth; and there Eol would meet the Naugrim \n",
      "and hold converse with them. And as their friendship grew \n",
      "he would at times go and dwell as guest in the deep \n",
      "mansions of Nogrod or Belegost There he learned much of \n",
      "metalwork, and came to great skill therein; and he devised \n",
      "a metal as hard as the steel of the Dwarves, but so \n",
      "malleable that he could make it thin and supple; and yet it \n",
      "remained resistant to all blades and darts. He named it \n",
      "galvom, for it was black and shining like jet, and he was \n",
      "clad in it whenever he went abroad. But Eol, though \n",
      "stooped by his smithwork, was no Dwarf, but a tall Elf of a \n",
      "high kin of the Teleri, noble though grim of face; and his \n",
      "eyes could see deep into shadows and dark places. And it \n",
      "came to pass that he saw Aredhel Ar-Feiniel as she \n",
      "strayed among the tall trees near the borders of Nan \n",
      "Elmoth, a gleam of white in the dim land. Very fair she \n",
      "seemed to him, and he desired her; and he set his \n",
      "enchantments about her so that she could not find the ways \n",
      "out, but drew ever nearer to his dwelling in the depths of the \n",
      "wood. There were his smithy, and his dim halls, and such \n",
      "servants as he had, silent and secret as their master. And \n",
      "when Aredhel, weary with wandering, came at last to his \n",
      "doors, he revealed himself; and he welcomed her, and led \n",
      "her into his house. And there she remained; for Eol took her \n",
      "to wife, and it was long ere any of her kin heard of her \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "again. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not said that Aredhel was wholly unwilling, nor that \n",
      "her life in Nan Elmoth was hateful to her for many years. For \n",
      "though at Eol's command she must shun the sunlight, they \n",
      "wandered far together under the stars or by the light of the \n",
      "sickle moon; or she might fare alone as she would, save \n",
      "that Eol forbade her to seek the sons of Feanor, or any \n",
      "others of the Noldor. And Aredhel bore to Eol a son in the \n",
      "shadows of Nan Elmoth, and in her heart she gave him a \n",
      "name in the forbidden tongue of the Noldor, Lomion, that \n",
      "signifies Child of the Twilight; but his father gave him no \n",
      "name until he was twelve years old. Then he called him \n",
      "Maeglin, which is Sharp Glance, for he perceived that the \n",
      "eyes of his son were more piercing than his own, and his \n",
      "thought could read the secrets of hearts beyond the mist of \n",
      "words. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As Maeglin grew to full stature he resembled in face \n",
      "and form rather his kindred of the Noldor, but in mood and \n",
      "mind he was the son of his father. His words were few save \n",
      "in matters that touched him near, and then his voice had a \n",
      "power to move those that heard him and to overthrow those \n",
      "that withstood him. He was tall and black-haired; his eyes \n",
      "were dark, yet bright and keen as the eyes of the Noldor, \n",
      "and his skin was white. Often he went with Eol to the cities \n",
      "of the Dwarves in the east of Ered Lindon, and there he \n",
      "learned eagerly what they would teach, and above all the \n",
      "craft of finding the ores of metals in the mountains. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yet it is said that Maeglin loved his mother better, and \n",
      "if Eol were abroad he would sit long beside her and listen \n",
      "to all that she could tell him of her kin and their deeds in \n",
      "Eldamar, and of the might and valour of the princes of the \n",
      "House of Fingolfin. All these things he laid to heart, but \n",
      "most of all that which he heard of Turgon, and that he had \n",
      "no heir; for Elenwe his wife perished in the crossing of the \n",
      "Helcaraxe, and his daughter Idril Celebrindal was his only \n",
      "child. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the telling of these tales there was awakened in \n",
      "Aredhel a desire to see her own kin again, and she \n",
      "marvelled that she had grown weary of the light of Gondolin, \n",
      "and the fountains in the sun, and the green sward of \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Tumladen under the windy skies of spring; moreover she \n",
      "was often alone in the shadows when both her son and her \n",
      "husband were away. Of these tales also grew the first \n",
      "quarrels of Maeglin and Eol. For by no means would his \n",
      "mother reveal to Maeglin where Turgon dwelt, nor by what \n",
      "means one might come thither, and he bided his time, \n",
      "trusting yet to wheedle the secret from her, or perhaps to \n",
      "read her unguarded mind; but ere that could be done he \n",
      "desired to look on the Noldor and speak with the sons of \n",
      "Feanor, his kin, that dwelt not far away. But when he \n",
      "declared his purpose to Eol, his father was wrathful. 'You \n",
      "are of the house of Eol, Maeglin, my son,' he said, 'and not \n",
      "of the Golodhrim. All this land is the land of the Teleri, and I \n",
      "will not deal nor have my son deal with the slayers of our \n",
      "kin, the invaders and usurpers of our homes. In this you \n",
      "shall obey me, or I will set you in bonds.' And Maeglin did \n",
      "not answer, but was cold and silent, and went abroad no \n",
      "more with Eol; and Eol mistrusted him. \n",
      "\n",
      "It came to pass that at the midsummer the Dwarves, \n",
      "as was their custom, bade Eol to a feast in Nogrod; and he \n",
      "rode away. Now Maeglin and his mother were free for a \n",
      "while to go where they wished, and they rode often to the \n",
      "eaves of the wood, seeking the sunlight; and desire grew \n",
      "hot in Maeglin's heart to leave Nan Elmoth for ever. \n",
      "Therefore he said to Aredhel: 'Lady, let us depart while \n",
      "there is time? What hope is there in this wood for you or for \n",
      "me? Here we are held in bondage, and no profit shall I find \n",
      "here; for I have learned all that my father has to teach, or \n",
      "that the Naugrim will reveal to me. Shall we not seek for \n",
      "Gondolin? You shall be my guide, and I will be your guard!' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Aredhel was glad, and looked with pride upon \n",
      "her son; and telling the servants of Eol that they went to \n",
      "seek the sons of Feanor they departed and rode away to \n",
      "the north eaves of Nan Elmoth. There they crossed the \n",
      "slender stream of Celon into the land of Himlad and rode \n",
      "on to the Fords of Arcs, and so westward along the fences \n",
      "of Doriath. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now Eol returned out of the east sooner than Maeglin \n",
      "had foreseen, and found his wife and his son but two days \n",
      "gone; and so great was his anger that he followed after \n",
      "them even by the light of day. As he entered the Himlad he \n",
      "mastered his wrath and went warily, remembering his \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "danger, for Celegorm and Curufin were mighty lords who \n",
      "loved Eol not at all, and Curufin moreover was of perilous \n",
      "mood; but the scouts of Aglon had marked the riding of \n",
      "Maeglin and Aredhel to the Fords of Aros, and Curufin \n",
      "perceiving that strange deeds were afoot came south from \n",
      "the Pass and encamped near the Fords. And before Eol \n",
      "had ridden far across the Himlad he was waylaid by the \n",
      "riders of Curufin, and taken to their lord. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Curufin said to Eol: 'What errand have you, Dark \n",
      "Elf, in my lands? An urgent matter, perhaps, that keeps one \n",
      "so sun-shy abroad by day.' \n",
      "\n",
      "And Eol knowing his peril restrained the bitter words \n",
      "that arose in his mind. 'I have learned. Lord Curufin,' he \n",
      "said, 'that my son and my wife, the White Lady of Gondolin, \n",
      "have ridden to visit you while I was from home; and it \n",
      "seemed to me fitting that I should join them on this errand.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Curufin laughed at Eol, and he said: 'They might \n",
      "have found their welcome here less warm than they hoped, \n",
      "had you accompanied them; but it is no matter, for that was \n",
      "not their errand. It is not two days since they passed over \n",
      "the Arossiach, and thence rode swiftly westward. It seems \n",
      "that you would deceive me; unless indeed you yourself have \n",
      "been deceived.' \n",
      "\n",
      "And Eol answered: 'Then, lord, perhaps you will give \n",
      "me leave to go, and discover the truth of this matter.' \n",
      "\n",
      "'You have my leave, but not my love,' said Curufin. 'The \n",
      "sooner you depart from my land the better will it please me.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Eol mounted his horse, saying: 'It is good, Lord \n",
      "Curufin, to find a kinsman thus kindly at need. I will \n",
      "remember it when I return.' Then Curufin looked darkly upon \n",
      "Eol. 'Do not flaunt the title of your wife before me,' he said. \n",
      "'For those who steal the daughters of the Noldor and wed \n",
      "them without gift or leave do not gain kinship with their kin. I \n",
      "have given you leave to go. Take it, and be gone. By the \n",
      "laws of the Eldar I may not slay you at this time. And this \n",
      "counsel I add: return now to your dwelling in the darkness of \n",
      "Nan El-moth; for my heart warns me that if you now pursue \n",
      "those who love you no more, never will you return thither.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Eol rode off in haste, and he was filled with \n",
      "hatred of all the Noldor; for he perceived now that Maeglin \n",
      "and Aredhel were fleeing to Gondolin. And driven by anger \n",
      "and the shame of his humiliation he crossed the Fords of \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Arcs and rode hard upon the way that they had gone \n",
      "before; but though they knew not that he followed them, and \n",
      "he had the swiftest steed, he came never in sight of them \n",
      "until they reached the Brithiach, and abandoned their \n",
      "horses. Then by ill fate they were betrayed; for the horses \n",
      "neighed loudly, and Eol's steed heard them, and sped \n",
      "towards them; and Eol saw from afar the white raiment of \n",
      "Aredhel, and marked which way she went, seeking the \n",
      "secret path into the mountains. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now Aredhel and Maeglin came to the Outer Gate of \n",
      "Gondolin and the Dark Guard under the mountains; and \n",
      "there she was received with Joy, and passing through the \n",
      "Seven Gates she came with Maeglin to Turgon upon Amon \n",
      "Gwareth. Then the King listened with wonder to all that \n",
      "Aredhel had to tell; and he looked with liking upon Maeglin \n",
      "his sister-son, seeing in him one worthy to be accounted \n",
      "among the princes of the Noldor. \n",
      "\n",
      "'I rejoice indeed that Ar-Feiniel has returned to \n",
      "Gondolin,' he said, 'and now more fair again shall my city \n",
      "seem than in the days when I deemed her lost. And Maeglin \n",
      "shall have the highest honour in my realm.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Maeglin bowed low and took Turgon for lord and \n",
      "king, to do all his will; but thereafter he stood silent and \n",
      "watchful, for the bliss and splendour of Gondolin surpassed \n",
      "all that he had imagined from the tales of his mother, and \n",
      "he was amazed by the strength of the city and the hosts of \n",
      "its people, and the many things strange and beautiful that \n",
      "he beheld. Yet to none were his eyes more often drawn \n",
      "than to Idril the King's daughter, who sat beside him; for she \n",
      "was golden as the Vanyar, her mother's kindred, and she \n",
      "seemed to him as the sun from which all the King's hall \n",
      "drew its light \n",
      "\n",
      "But Eol, following after Aredhel, found the Dry River \n",
      "and the secret path, and so creeping in by stealth he came \n",
      "to the Guard, and was taken and questioned. And when the \n",
      "Guard heard that he claimed Aredhel as wife they were \n",
      "amazed, and sent a swift messenger to the City; and he \n",
      "came to the King's hall. \n",
      "\n",
      "'Lord,' he cried, 'the Guard have taken captive one that \n",
      "came by stealth to the Dark Gate. Eol he names himself, \n",
      "and he is a tall Elf, dark and grim, of the kindred of the \n",
      "Sindar; yet he claims the Lady Aredhel as his wife, and \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "demands to be brought before you. His wrath is great and \n",
      "he is hard to restrain; but we have not slain him as your law \n",
      "commands.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Aredhel said: 'Alas! Eol has followed us, even as \n",
      "I feared. But with great stealth was it done; for we saw and \n",
      "heard no pursuit as we entered upon the Hidden Way.' \n",
      "Then she said to the messenger: 'He speaks but the truth. \n",
      "He is Eol, and I am his wife, and he is the father of my son. \n",
      "Slay him not, but lead him hither to the King's judgement, if \n",
      "the King so wills.' \n",
      "\n",
      "And so it was done; and Eol was brought to Turgon's \n",
      "hall and stood before his high seat, proud and sullen. \n",
      "Though he was amazed no less than his son at all that he \n",
      "saw, his heart was filled the more with anger and with hate \n",
      "of the Noldor. But Turgon treated him with honour, and rose \n",
      "up and would take his hand; and he said: \"Welcome, \n",
      "kinsman, for so I hold you. Here you shall dwell at your \n",
      "pleasure, save only that you must here abide and depart \n",
      "not from my kingdom; for it is my law that none who finds \n",
      "the way hither shall depart.' \n",
      "\n",
      "But Eol withdrew his hand. 'I acknowledge not your \n",
      "law,' he said. 'No right have you or any of your kin in this \n",
      "land to seize realms or to set bounds, either here or there. \n",
      "This is the land of the Teleri, to which you bring war and all \n",
      "unquiet, dealing ever proudly and unjustly. I care nothing for \n",
      "your secrets and I came not to spy upon you, but to claim \n",
      "my own: my wife and my son. Yet if in Aredhel your sister \n",
      "you have some claim, then let her remain; let the bird go \n",
      "back to the cage, where soon she will sicken again, as she \n",
      "sickened before. But not so Maeglin. My son you shall not \n",
      "withhold from me. Come, Maeglin son of Eol! Your father \n",
      "commands you. Leave the house of his enemies and the \n",
      "slayers of his kin, or be accursed!' But Maeglin answered \n",
      "nothing. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Turgon sat in his high seat holding his staff of \n",
      "doom, and in a stem voice spoke: 'I will not debate with \n",
      "you. Dark Elf. By the swords of the Noldor alone are your \n",
      "sunless woods defended. Your freedom to wander there \n",
      "wild you owe to my kin; and but for them long since you \n",
      "would have laboured in thraldom in the pits of Angband. \n",
      "And here I am King; and whether you will it or will it not, my \n",
      "doom is law. This choice only is given to you: to abide here, \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "or to die here; and so also for your son.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Eol looked into the eyes of King Turgon, and he \n",
      "was not daunted, but stood long without word or movement \n",
      "while a still silence fell upon the hall; and Aredhel was \n",
      "afraid, knowing that he was perilous. Suddenly, swift as \n",
      "serpent, he seized a javelin that he held hid beneath his \n",
      "cloak and cast it at Maeglin, crying: \n",
      "\n",
      "The second choice I take and for my son also! You \n",
      "shall not hold what is mine!' \n",
      "\n",
      "But Aredhel sprang before the dart, and it smote her in \n",
      "the shoulder; and Eol was overborne by many and set in \n",
      "bonds, and led away, while others tended Aredhel. But \n",
      "Maeglin looking upon his father was silent. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was appointed that Eol should be brought on the next \n",
      "day to the King's judgement; and Aredhel and Idril moved \n",
      "Turgon to mercy. But in the evening Aredhel sickened, \n",
      "though the wound had seemed little, and she fell into the \n",
      "darkness, and in the night she died; for the point of the \n",
      "javelin was poisoned, though none knew it until too late. \n",
      "\n",

      "When three hundred years and more were gone since \n",

      "Peace, Finrod Felagund lord of Nargothrond journeyed \n",
      "east of Sirion and went hunting with Maglor and Maedhros, \n",
      "sons of Feanor. But he wearied of the chase and passed \n",
      "on alone towards the mountains of Ered Lindon that he saw \n",
      "shining afar; and taking the Dwarf-road he crossed Gelion \n",
      "at the ford of Sarn Athrad, and taming south over the upper \n",
      "streams of Ascar, he came into the north of Ossiriand. \n",
      "\n",
      "In a valley among the foothills of the mountains, below \n",
      "the springs of Thalos, he saw lights in the evening, and far \n",
      "off he heard the sound of song. At this he wondered much, \n",
      "for the Green-elves of that land lit no fires, nor did they sing \n",
      "by night At first he feared that a raid of Ores had passed \n",
      "the leaguer of the North, but as he drew near he perceived \n",
      "that it was not so; for the singers used a tongue that he had \n",
      "not heard before, neither that of Dwarves nor of Ores. Then \n",
      "Felagund, standing silent hi the night-shadow of the trees, \n",
      "looked down into the camp, and there he beheld a strange \n",
      "people. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now these were a part of the kindred and following of \n",
      "Beor the Old, as he was afterwards called, a chieftain \n",
      "among Men. After many lives of wandering out of the East \n",
      "he had led them at last over the Blue Mountains, the first of \n",
      "the race of Men to enter Beleriand; and they sang because \n",
      "they were glad, and believed that they had escaped from all \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Long Felagund watched them, and love for them \n",
      "stirred in his heart; but he remained hidden in the trees until \n",
      "they had all fallen asleep. Then he went among the sleeping \n",
      "people, and sat beside their dying fire where none kept \n",
      "watch; and he took up a rude harp which Beor had laid \n",
      "aside, and he played music upon it such as the ears of Men \n",
      "had not heard; for they had as yet no teachers in the art, \n",
      "save only the Dark Elves in the wild lands. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now men awoke and listened to Felagund as he \n",
      "harped and sang, and each thought that he was in some \n",
      "fair dream, until he saw that his fellows were awake also \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "beside him; but they did not speak or stir while Felagund \n",
      "still played, because of the beauty of the music and the \n",
      "wonder of the song. Wisdom was in the words of the Elven- \n",
      "king, and the hearts grew wiser that hearkened to him; for \n",
      "the things of which he sang, of the making of Arda, and the \n",
      "bliss of Aman beyond the shadows of the Sea, came as \n",
      "clear visions before their eyes, and his Elvish speech was \n",
      "interpreted in each mind according to its measure. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus it was that Men called King Felagund, whom they \n",
      "first met of all the Eldar, Norn, that is Wisdom, in the \n",
      "language of that people, and after him they named his folk \n",
      "Nomin, the Wise. Indeed they believed at first that Felagund \n",
      "was one of the Valar, of whom they had heard rumour that \n",
      "they dwelt far in the West; and this was (some say) the \n",
      "cause of their journeying. But Felagund dwelt among them \n",
      "and taught them true knowledge, and they loved him, and \n",
      "took him for their lord, and were ever after loyal to the \n",
      "house of Finarfin. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now the Eldar were beyond all other peoples skilled in \n",
      "tongues; and Felagund discovered also that he could read \n",
      "in the minds of Men such thoughts as they wished to reveal \n",
      "in speech, so that their words were easily interpreted. It is \n",
      "said also that these Men had long had dealings with the \n",
      "Dark Elves east of the mountains, and from them had \n",
      "learned much of their speech; and since all the languages \n",
      "of the Quendi were of one origin, the language of Beor and \n",
      "his folk resembled the Elven-tongue in many words and \n",
      "devices. It was not long therefore before Felagund could \n",
      "hold converse with Beor; and while he dwelt with him they \n",
      "spoke much together. But when he questioned him \n",
      "concerning the arising of Men and their journeys, Beor \n",
      "would say little; and indeed he knew little, for the fathers of \n",
      "his people had told few tales of their past and a silence had \n",
      "fallen upon their memory. 'A darkness lies behind us,' Beor \n",
      "said; 'and we have turned our backs upon it, and we do not \n",
      "desire to return thither even in thought. Westwards our \n",
      "hearts have been turned, and we believe that there we shall \n",
      "find Light.' \n",
      "\n",
      "But it was said afterwards among the Eldar that when \n",
      "Men awoke in Hildorien at the rising of the Sun the spies of \n",
      "Morgoth were watchful, and tidings were soon brought to \n",
      "him; and this seemed to him so great a matter that secretly \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "under shadow he himself departed from Angband, and \n",
      "went forth into Middle-earth, leaving to Sauron the \n",
      "command of the War. Of his dealings with Men the Eldar \n",
      "indeed knew nothing, at that time, and learnt but little \n",
      "afterwards; but that a darkness lay upon the hearts of Men \n",
      "(as the shadow of the Kinslaying and the Doom of Mandos \n",
      "lay upon the Noldor) they perceived clearly even in the \n",
      "people of the Elf-friends whom they first knew. To corrupt or \n",
      "destroy whatsoever arose new and fair was ever the chief \n",
      "desire of Morgoth; and doubtless he had this purpose also \n",
      "in his errand: by fear and lies to make Men the foes of the \n",
      "Eldar, and bring them up out of the east against Beleriand. \n",
      "But this design was slow to ripen, and was never wholly \n",
      "achieved; for Men (it is said) were at first very few in \n",
      "number, whereas Morgoth grew afraid of the growing \n",
      "power and union of the Eldar and came back to Angband, \n",
      "leaving behind at that time but few servants, and those of \n",
      "less might and cunning. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now Felagund learned from Beor that there were many \n",
      "other Men of like mind who were also journeying westward. \n",
      "'Others of my own kin have crossed the Mountains,' he \n",
      "said, 'and they are wandering not far away; and the \n",
      "Haladin, a people from whom we are sundered in speech, \n",
      "are still in the valleys on the eastern slopes, awaiting tidings \n",
      "before they venture further. There are yet other Men, whose \n",
      "tongue is more like to ours, with whom we have had \n",
      "dealings at times. They were before us on the westward \n",
      "march, but we passed them; for they are a numerous \n",
      "people, and yet keep together and move slowly, being all \n",
      "ruled by one chieftain whom they call Marach.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Now the Green-elves of Ossiriand were troubled by the \n",
      "coming of Men, and when they heard that a lord of the Eldar \n",
      "from over the Sea was among them they sent messengers \n",
      "to Felagund. 'Lord,' they said, 'if you have power over these \n",
      "newcomers, bid them return by the ways that they came, or \n",
      "else to go forward. For we desire no strangers in this land \n",
      "to break the peace in which we live. And these folk are \n",
      "hewers of trees and hunters of beasts; therefore we are \n",
      "their unfriends, and if they will not depart we shall afflict \n",
      "them in all ways that we can.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then by the advice of Felagund Beor gathered all the \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "wandering families and kindreds of his people, and they \n",
      "removed over Gelion, and took up their abode in the lands \n",
      "of Amrod and Amras, upon the east banks of the Celon \n",
      "south of Nan Elmoth, near to the borders of Doriath; and the \n",
      "name of that land thereafter was Estolad, the Encampment. \n",
      "But when after a year had passed Felagund wished to \n",
      "return to his own country, Beor begged leave to come with \n",
      "him; and he remained in the service of the King of \n",
      "Nargothrond while his life lasted. In this way he got his \n",
      "name, Beor, whereas his name before had been Balan; for \n",
      "Beor signified 'Vassal' in the tongue of his people. The rule \n",
      "of his folk he committed to Baran his elder son; and he did \n",
      "not return again to Estolad. \n",
      "\n",
      "Soon after the departure of Felagund the other Men of \n",
      "whom Beor had spoken came also into Beleriand. First \n",
      "came the Haladin; but meeting the unfriendship of the \n",
      "Green-elves they turned north and dwelt in Thargelion, in \n",
      "the country of Caranthir son of Feanor; there for a time they \n",
      "had peace, and the people of Caranthir paid little heed to \n",
      "them. In the next year Marach led his people over the \n",
      "mountains; they were a tall and warlike folk, marching in \n",
      "ordered companies, and the Elves of Ossiriand hid \n",
      "themselves and did not waylay them. But Marach, hearing \n",
      "that the people of Beor were dwelling in a green and fertile \n",
      "land, came down the Dwarf-road, and settled in the country \n",
      "south ; and east of the dwellings of Baran son of Beor; and \n",
      "there was great friendship between those peoples. \n",
      "\n",
      "Felagund himself often returned to visit Men; and many \n",
      "other Elves out of the west-lands, both Noldor and Sindar, \n",
      "Journeyed to Estolad, being eager to see the Edain, whose \n",
      "coming had long been foretold. Now Atani, the Second \n",
      "People, was the name given to Men in Valinor in the lore \n",
      "that told of their coming; but in the speech of Beleriand that \n",
      "name became Edain, and it was there used only of the \n",
      "three kindreds of the Elf-friends. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fingolfin, as King of all the Noldor, sent messengers of \n",
      "welcome to them; and then many young and eager men of \n",
      "the Edain went away and took service with the kings and \n",
      "lords of the Eldar. Among them was Malach son of Marach, \n",
      "and he dwelt in Hithlum for fourteen years; and he learned \n",
      "the Elven-tongue and was given the name of Aradan. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Edain did not long dwell content in Estolad, for \n",
      "many still desired to go westward; but they did not know the \n",
      "way. Before them lay the fences of Doriath, and southward \n",
      "lay Sirion and its impassable fens. Therefore the kings of \n",
      "the three houses of the Noldor, seeing hope of strength in \n",
      "the sons of Men, sent word that any of the Edain that \n",
      "wished might remove and come to dwell among their \n",
      "people. In this way the migration of the Edain began: at first \n",
      "little by little, but later in families and kindreds, they arose \n",
      "and left Estolad, until after some fifty years many thousands \n",
      "had entered the lands of the Kings. Most of these took the \n",
      "long road northwards, until the ways became well known to \n",
      "them. The people of Beor came to Dorthonion and dwelt in \n",
      "lands ruled by the house of Finarfin. The people of Aradan \n",
      "(for Marach his father remained in Estolad until his death) \n",
      "for the most part went on westward; and some came to \n",
      "Hithlum, but Magor son of Aradan and many of the people \n",
      "passed down Sirion into Beleriand and dwelt a while in the \n",
      "vales of the southern slopes of Ered Wethrin. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is said that in all these matters none save Finrod \n",
      "Felagund took counsel with King Thingol, and he was ill \n",
      "pleased, both for that reason, and because he was troubled \n",
      "by dreams concerning the coming of Men, ere ever the first \n",
      "tidings of them were heard. Therefore he commanded that \n",
      "Men should take no lands to dwell in save in the north, and \n",
      "that the princes whom they served should be answerable \n",
      "for all that they did; and he said: 'Into Doriath shall no Man \n",
      "come while my realm lasts, not even those of the house of \n",
      "Beor who serve Finrod the beloved.' Melian said nothing to \n",
      "him at that time, but afterwards she said to Galadriel: 'Now \n",
      "the world runs on swiftly to great tidings. And one of Men, \n",
      "even of Beor's house, shall indeed come, and the Girdle of \n",
      "Melian shall not restrain him, for doom greater than my \n",
      "power shall send him; and the songs that shall spring from \n",
      "that coming shall endure when all Middle-earth is changed.' \n",
      "\n",
      "But many Men remained in Estolad, and there was still \n",
      "a mingled people living there long years after, until in the \n",
      "ruin of Beleriand they were overwhelmed or fled back into \n",
      "the East. For beside the old who deemed that their \n",
      "wandering days were over there were not a few who \n",
      "desired to go their own ways, and they feared the Eldar and \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the light of their eyes; and then dissensions awoke among \n",
      "the Edain, in which the shadow of Morgoth may be \n",
      "discerned, for certain it is that he knew of the coming of \n",
      "Men into Beleriand and of their growing friendship with the \n",
      "Elves. \n",
      "\n",
      "The leaders of discontent were Bereg of the house of \n",
      "Beor, and Amlach, one of the grandsons of Marach; and \n",
      "they said openly: 'We took long roads, desiring to escape \n",
      "the perils of Middle-earth and the dark things that dwell \n",
      "there; for we heard that there was Light in the West. But \n",
      "now we learn that the Light is beyond the Sea. Thither we \n",
      "cannot come where the Gods dwell in bliss. Save one; for \n",
      "the Lord of the Dark is here before us, and the Eldar, wise \n",
      "but fell, who make endless war upon him. In the North he \n",
      "dwells, they say; and there is the pain and death from which \n",
      "we fled. We will not go that way.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then a council and assembly of Men was called, and \n",
      "great numbers came together. And the Elf-friends \n",
      "answered Bereg, saying: Truly from the Dark King come all \n",
      "the evils from which we fled; but he seeks dominion over all \n",
      "Middle-earth, and whither now shall we turn and he will not \n",
      "pursue us? Unless he be vanquished here, or at least held \n",
      "in leaguer. Only by the valour of the Eldar is he restrained, \n",
      "and maybe it was for this purpose, to aid them at need, that \n",
      "we were brought into this land.' \n",
      "\n",
      "To this Bereg answered: 'Let the Eldar look to it! Our \n",
      "lives are short enough.' But there arose one who seemed to \n",
      "all to be Amlach son of Imlach, speaking fell words that \n",
      "shook the hearts of all who heard him: 'All this is but Elvish \n",
      "lore, tales to beguile newcomers that are unwary. The Sea \n",
      "has no shore. There is no Light in the West. You have \n",
      "followed a fool-fire of the Elves to the end of the world! \n",
      "Which of you has seen the least of the Gods? Who has \n",
      "beheld the Dark King in the North? Those who seek the \n",
      "dominion of Middle-earth are the Eldar. Greedy for wealth \n",
      "they have delved in the earth for its secrets and have stirred \n",
      "to wrath the things that dwell beneath it, as they have ever \n",
      "done and ever shall. Let the Ores have the realm that is \n",
      "theirs, and we will have ours. There is room in the world, if \n",
      "the Eldar will let us be!' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then those that listened sat for a while astounded, and \n",
      "a shadow of fear fell on their hearts; and they resolved to \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "depart far from the lands of the Eldar. But afterwards \n",
      "Amlach returned among them, and denied that he had been \n",
      "present at their debate or had spoken such words as they \n",
      "reported; and there was doubt and bewilderment among \n",
      "Men. Then the Elf-friends said: 'You will now believe this at \n",
      "least: there is indeed a Dark Lord, and his spies and \n",
      "emissaries are among us; for he fears us, and the strength \n",
      "that we may give to his foes.' \n",
      "\n",
      "But some still answered: 'He hates us, rather, and ever \n",
      "the more the longer we dwell here, meddling in his quarrel \n",
      "with the Kings of the Eldar, to no gain of ours.' Many \n",
      "therefore of those that yet remained in Estolad made ready \n",
      "to depart; and Bereg led a thousand of the people of Beor \n",
      "away southwards, and they passed out of the songs of \n",
      "those days. But Amlach repented, saying: 'I have now a \n",
      "quarrel of my own with this Master of Lies, which will last to \n",
      "my life's end'; and he went away north and entered the \n",
      "service of Maedhros. But those of his people who were of \n",
      "like mind with Bereg chose a new leader, and they went \n",
      "back over the mountains into Eriador, and are forgotten. \n",
      "\n",
      "During this time the Haladin remained in Thargelion \n",
      "and were content. But Morgoth, seeing that by lies and \n",
      "deceits he could not yet wholly estrange Elves and Men, \n",
      "was filled with wrath, and endeavoured to do Men what hurt \n",
      "he could. Therefore he sent out an Ore-raid, and passing \n",
      "east it escaped the leaguer, and came in stealth back over \n",
      "Ered Lindon by the passes of the Dwarf-road, and fell upon \n",
      "the Haladin in the southern woods of the land of Caranthir. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now the Haladin did not live under the rule of lords or \n",
      "many together, but each homestead was set apart and \n",
      "governed its own affairs, and they were slow to unite. But \n",
      "there was among them a man named Haldad, who was \n",
      "masterful and fearless; and he gathered all the brave men \n",
      "that he could find, and retreated to the angle of land \n",
      "between Ascar and Gelion, and in the utmost comer he \n",
      "built a stockade across from water to water; and behind it \n",
      "they led all the women and children that they could save. \n",
      "There they were besieged, until their food was gone. \n",
      "\n",
      "Haldad had twin children: Haleth his daughter, and \n",
      "Haidar his son; and both were valiant in the defence, for \n",
      "Haleth was a woman of great heart and strength. But at last \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Haldad was slain in a sortie against the Ores; and Haidar, \n",
      "who rushed out to save his father's body from their \n",
      "butchery, was hewn down beside him. Then Haleth held the \n",
      "people together, though they were without hope; and some \n",
      "cast themselves in the rivers and were drowned. But seven \n",
      "days later, as the Ores made their last assault and had \n",
      "already broken through the stockade, there came suddenly \n",
      "a music of trumpets, and Caranthir with his host came \n",
      "down from the north and drove the Ores into the rivers. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Caranthir looked kindly upon Men and did Haleth \n",
      "great honour; and he offered her recompense for her father \n",
      "and brother. And seeing, over late, what valour there was in \n",
      "the Edain, he said to her: 'If you will remove and dwell \n",
      "further north, there you shall have the friendship and \n",
      "protection of the Eldar, and free lands of your own.' \n",
      "\n",
      "But Haleth was proud, and unwilling to be guided or \n",
      "ruled, and most of the Haladin were of like mood. Therefore \n",
      "she thanked Caranthir, but answered: 'My mind is now set, \n",
      "lord, to leave the shadow of the mountains, and go west, \n",
      "whither others of our kin have gone.' When therefore the \n",
      "Haladin had gathered all whom they could find alive of their \n",
      "folk who had fled wild into the woods before the Ores, and \n",
      "had gleaned what remained of their goods in their burned \n",
      "homesteads, they took Haleth for their chief; and she led \n",
      "them at last to Estolad, and there dwelt for a time. But they \n",
      "remained a people apart, and were ever after known to \n",
      "Elves and Men as the People of Haleth. Haleth remained \n",
      "their chief while her days lasted, but she did not wed, and \n",
      "the headship afterwards passed to Haldan son of Haidar \n",
      "her brother. Soon however Haleth desired to move \n",
      "westward again; and though most of her people were \n",
      "against this counsel, she led them forth once more; and \n",
      "they went without help or guidance of the Eldar, and \n",
      "passing over Celon and Arcs they journeyed in the perilous \n",
      "land between the Mountains of Terror and the Girdle of \n",
      "Melian. That land was even then not yet so evil as it after \n",
      "became, but it was no road for mortal Men to take without \n",
      "aid, and Haleth only brought her people through it with \n",
      "hardship and loss, constraining them to go forward by the \n",
      "strength of her will. At last they crossed over the Brithiach, \n",
      "and many bitterly repented of their journey; but there was \n",
      "now no returning. Therefore in new lands they went back to \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "their old life as best they could; and they dwelt in free \n",
      "homesteads in the woods of Talath Dirnen beyond Teiglin, \n",
      "and some wandered far into the realm of Nargothrond. But \n",
      "there were many who loved the Lady Haleth and wished to \n",
      "go whither she would, and dwell under her rule; and these \n",
      "she led into the Forest of Brethil, between Teiglin and \n",
      "Sirion. Thither in the evil days that followed many of her \n",
      "scattered folk returned. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now Brethil was claimed as part of his realm by King \n",
      "Thingol, though it was not within the Girdle of Melian, and \n",
      "he would have denied it to Haleth; but Felagund, who had \n",
      "the friendship of Thingol, hearing of all that had befallen the \n",
      "People of Haleth, obtained this grace for her: that she \n",
      "should dwell free in Brethil, upon the condition only that her \n",
      "people should guard the Crossings of Teiglin against all \n",
      "enemies of the Eldar, and allow no Ores to enter their \n",
      "woods. To this Haleth answered: 'Where are Haldad my \n",
      "father, and Haidar my brother? If the King of Doriath fears a \n",
      "friendship between Haleth and those who have devoured \n",
      "her kin, then the thoughts of the Eldar are strange to Men.' \n",
      "And Haleth dwelt in Brethil until she died; and her people \n",
      "raised a green mound over her in the heights of the forest, \n",
      "Tur Haretha, the Ladybarrow, Haudh-en-Arwen in the \n",
      "Sindarin tongue. \n",
      "\n",
      "In this way it came to pass that the Edain dwelt in the \n",
      "lands of the Eldar, some here, some there, some \n",
      "wandering, some settled in kindreds or small peoples; and \n",
      "the most part of them soon learned the Grey-elven tongue, \n",
      "both as a common speech among themselves and \n",
      "because many were eager to learn the lore of the Elves. \n",
      "But after a time the Elf-kings, seeing that it was not good \n",
      "for Elves and Men to dwell mingled together without order, \n",
      "and that Men needed lords of their own kind, set regions \n",
      "apart where Men could live their own lives, and appointed \n",
      "chieftains to hold these lands freely. They were the allies of \n",
      "the Eldar in war, but marched under their own leaders. Yet \n",
      "many of the Edain had delight in the friendship of the Elves, \n",
      "and dwelt among them for so long as they had leave; and \n",
      "the young men often took service for a time in the hosts of \n",
      "the kings. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now Hador Lorindol, son of Hathol, son of Magor, son \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "to him the lordship of Dor-lomin, and into that land he \n",
      "gathered most of the people of his kin, and became the \n",
      "mightiest of the chieftains of the Edain. In his house only the \n",
      "Elven-tongue was spoken; but their own speech was not \n",
      "forgotten, and from it came the common tongue of \n",

      "in those days the strength of Men was added to the power \n",
      "of the Noldor, and their hope was high; and Morgoth was \n",
      "straitly enclosed, for the people of Hador, being hardy to \n",
      "endure cold and long wandering, feared sot at times to go \n",
      "far into the north and there keep watch upon the \n",
      "movements of the Enemy. The Men of the Three Houses \n",

      "they were of lesser stature, and less eager for lore. They \n",

      "and many among them delighted in solitude, wandering \n",
      "free in the greenwoods while the wonder of the lands of the \n",

      "the loss of their friends. But Beor at the last had \n",
      "relinquished his life willingly and passed in peace; and the \n",

      "valiant, pondered once more an assault upon Angband; for \n",
      "he knew that they lived in danger while the circle of the \n",
      "siege was incomplete, and Morgoth was free to labour in \n",
      "his deep mines, devising what evils none could foretell ere \n",
      "he should reveal them. This counsel was wise according to \n",
      "the measure of his knowledge; for the Noldor did not yet \n",
      "comprehend the fullness of the power of Morgoth, nor \n",
      "understand that their unaided war upon him was without \n",
      "final hope, whether they hasted or delayed. But because \n",
      "the land was fair and their kingdoms wide, most of the \n",
      "Noldor were content with things as they were, trusting them \n",
      "to last, and slow to begin an assault in which many must \n",
      "surely perish were it in victory or in defeat Therefore they \n",
      "were little disposed to hearken to Fingolfin, and the sons of \n",
      "Feanor at that time least of all. Among the chieftains of the \n",
      "Noldor Angrod and Aegnor alone were of like mind with the \n",
      "King; for they dwelt in regions whence Thangorodrim could \n",
      "be descried, and the threat of Morgoth was present to their \n",
      "thought. Thus the designs of Fingolfin came to naught, and \n",

      "Fingolfin, the evil befell that he had long dreaded, and yet \n",
      "more dire and sudden than his darkest fear. For Morgoth \n",
      "had long prepared his force in secret, while ever the malice \n",
      "of his heart grew greater, and his hatred of the Noldor more \n",
      "bitter; and he desired not only to end his foes but to destroy \n",
      "also and defile the lands that they had taken and made fair. \n",
      "And it is said that his hate overcame his counsel, so that if \n",
      "he had but endured to wait longer, until his designs were \n",
      "full, then the Noldor would have perished utterly. But on his \n",

      "There came a time of winter, when night was dark and \n",

      "dim beneath the cold stars, from the hill-forts of the Noldor \n",
      "to the feet of Thangorodrim. The watch-fires burned low, \n",
      "and the guards were few; on the plain few were waking in \n",
      "the camps of the horsemen of Hithlum. Then suddenly \n",
      "Morgoth sent forth great rivers of flame that ran down \n",
      "swifter than Balrogs from Thangorodrim, and poured over \n",
      "all the plain; and the Mountains of Iron belched forth fires of \n",
      "many poisonous hues, and the fume of them stank upon the \n",
      "air, and was deadly. Thus Ard-galen perished, and fire \n",
      "devoured its grasses; and it became a burned and \n",
      "desolate waste, full of a choking dust, barren and lifeless. \n",
      "Thereafter its name was changed, and it was called \n",
      "Anfauglith, the Gasping Dust. Many charred bones had \n",
      "there their roofless grave; for many of the Noldor perished \n",
      "in that burning, who were caught by the running flame and \n",
      "could not fly to the hills. The heights of Dorthonion and Ered \n",

      "multitudes such as the Noldor had never before seen or \n",
      "imagined. And they assaulted the fortresses of the Noldor, \n",
      "and broke the leaguer about Angband, and slew wherever \n",
      "they found them the Noldor and their allies. Grey-elves and \n",
      "Men. Many of the stoutest of the foes of Morgoth were \n",
      "destroyed in the first days of that war, bewildered and \n",
      "dispersed and unable to muster their strength. War ceased \n",
      "not wholly ever again in Beleriand; but the Battle of Sudden \n",

      "Elves. Then Galdor the Tall took the lordship of his father. \n",
      "And because of the strength and height of the Shadowy \n",
      "Mountains, which withstood the torrent of fire, and by the \n",
      "valour of the Elves and the Men of the North, which neither \n",
      "Ore nor Balrog could yet overcome, Hithlum remained \n",
      "unconquered, a threat upon the flank of Morgoth's attack; \n",

      "hosts of Morgoth; and Celegorm and Curufin being \n",
      "defeated fled south and west by the marches of Doriath, \n",
      "and coming at last to Nargothrond sought harbour with \n",
      "Finrod Felagund. Thus it came to pass that their people \n",
      "swelled the strength of Nargothrond; but it would have been \n",
      "better, as was after seen, if they had remained in the east \n",
      "among their own kin. Maedhros did deeds of surpassing \n",

      "fire within, and he was as one that returns from the dead. \n",

      "passed through Maglor's Gap, and destroyed all the land \n",
      "between the arms of Gelion. And the Ores took the fortress \n",
      "upon the west slopes of Mount Rerir, and ravaged all \n",
      "Thargelion, the land of Caranthir; and they defiled Lake \n",
      "Helevorn. Thence they passed over Gelion with fire and \n",
      "terror and came far into East Beleriand. Maglor joined \n",
      "Maedhros upon Himring; but Caranthir fled and joined the \n",
      "remnant of his people to the scattered folk of the hunters, \n",
      "Amrod and Amras, and they retreated and passed Ramdal \n",
      "in the south. Upon Amon Ereb they maintained a watch and \n",
      "some strength of war, and they had aid of the Green-elves; \n",
      "and the Ores came not into Ossiriand, nor to Taur-im- \n",
      "Duinath and the wilds of the south. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now news came to Hithlum that Dorthonion was lost \n",
      "and the sons of Finarfin overthrown, and that the sons of \n",
      "Feanor were driven from their lands. Then Fingolfin beheld \n",
      "(as it seemed to him) the utter ruin of the Noldor, and the \n",
      "defeat beyond redress of all their houses; and filled with \n",
      "wrath and despair he mounted upon Rochallor his great \n",
      "horse and rode forth alone, and none might restrain him. He \n",
      "passed over Dor-nu-Fauglith like a wind amid the dust, and \n",
      "all that beheld his onset fled in amaze, thinking that Orome \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "himself was come: for a great madness of rage was upon \n",
      "him, so that his eyes shone like the eyes of the Valar. Thus \n",
      "he came alone to Angband's gates, and he sounded his \n",
      "horn, and smote once more upon the brazen doors, and \n",
      "challenged Morgoth to come forth to single combat. And \n",
      "Morgoth came. \n",
      "\n",
      "That was the last time in those wars that he passed the \n",
      "doors of his stronghold, and it is said that he took not the \n",
      "challenge willingly; for though his might was greatest of all \n",
      "things in this world, alone of the Valar he knew fear. But he \n",
      "could not now deny the challenge before the face of his \n",
      "captains; for the rocks rang with the shrill music of \n",
      "Fingolfin's horn, and his voice came keen and clear down \n",
      "into the depths of Angband; and Fingolfin named Morgoth \n",
      "craven, and lord of slaves. Therefore Morgoth came, \n",
      "climbing slowly from his subterranean throne, and the \n",
      "rumour of his feet was like thunder underground. And he \n",
      "issued forth clad in black armour; and he stood before the \n",
      "King like a tower, iron-crowned, and his vast shield, sable \n",
      "on-blazoned, cast a shadow over him like a stormcloud. But \n",
      "Fingolfin gleamed beneath it as a star; for his mail was \n",
      "overlaid with silver, and his blue shield was set with \n",
      "crystals; and he drew his sword Ringil, that glittered like ice. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Morgoth hurled aloft Grand, the Hammer of the \n",
      "Underworld, and swung it down like a bolt of thunder. But \n",
      "Fingolfin sprang aside, and Grand rent a mighty pit in the \n",
      "earth, whence smoke and fire darted. Many times Morgoth \n",
      "essayed to smite him, and each time Fingolfin leaped \n",
      "away, as a 'lightning shoots from under a dark cloud; and \n",
      "he wounded Morgoth with seven wounds, and seven times \n",
      "Morgoth gave a cry of anguish, whereat the hosts of \n",
      "Angband fell upon their faces in dismay, and the cries \n",
      "echoed in the Northlands. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But at the last the King grew weary, and Morgoth bore \n",
      "down his shield upon him. Thrice he was crushed to his \n",
      "knees, and thrice arose again and bore up his broken \n",
      "shield and stricken helm. But the earth was all rent and \n",
      "pitted about him, and he stumbled and fell backward before \n",
      "the feet of Morgoth; and Morgoth set his left foot upon his \n",
      "neck, and the weight of it was like a fallen hill. Yet with his \n",
      "last and desperate stroke Fingolfin hewed the foot with \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ringil, and the blood gashed forth black and smoking and \n",
      "filled the pits of Grand. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus died Fingolfin, High King of the Noldor, most \n",
      "proud and valiant of the Elven-kings of old. The Ores made \n",
      "no boast of that duel at the gate; neither do the Elves sing \n",
      "of it, for their sorrow is too deep. Yet the tale of it is \n",
      "remembered still, for Thorondor King of Eagles brought the \n",
      "tidings to Gondolin, and to Hithlum afar off. And Morgoth \n",
      "took the body of the Elven-king and broke it, and would cast \n",
      "it to his wolves; but Thorondor came hasting from his eyrie \n",
      "among the peaks of the Crissaegrim, and he stooped upon \n",
      "Morgoth and marred his face. The rushing of the wings of \n",
      "Thorondor was like the noise of the winds of Manwe, and \n",
      "he seized the body in his mighty talons, and soaring \n",
      "suddenly above the darts of the Ores he bore the King \n",
      "away. And he laid him upon a mountain-top that looked \n",
      "from the north upon the hidden valley of Gondolin; and \n",
      "Turgon coming built a high cairn over his father. No Ore \n",
      "dared ever after to pass over the mount of Fingolfin or draw \n",
      "nigh his tomb, until the doom of Gondolin was come and \n",
      "treachery was bom among his kin. Morgoth went ever halt \n",
      "of one foot after that day, and the pain of his wounds could \n",
      "not be healed; and in his face was the scar that Thorondor \n",
      "made. \n",
      "\n",
      "Great was the lamentation in Hithlum when the fall of \n",
      "Fingolfin became known, and Fingon in sorrow took the \n",
      "lordship of the house of Fingolfin and the kingdom of the \n",
      "Noldor; but his young son Ereinion (who was after named \n",
      "Gil-galad) he sent to the Havens. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now Morgoth's power overshadowed the Northlands; \n",
      "but Barahir would not flee from Dorthonion, and remained \n",
      "contesting the land foot by foot with his enemies. Then \n",
      "Morgoth pursued his people to the death, until few \n",
      "remained; and all the forest of the northward slopes of that \n",
      "land was turned little by little into a region of such dread and \n",
      "dark enchantment that even the Ores would not enter it \n",
      "unless need drove them, and it was called Delduwath, and \n",
      "Taur-nu-Fuin, The Forest under Nightshade. The trees that \n",
      "grew there after the burning were black and grim, and their \n",
      "roots were tangled, groping in the dark like claws; and \n",
      "those who strayed among them became lost and blind, and \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "were strangled or pursued to madness by phantoms of \n",
      "terror. At last so desperate was the case of Barahir that \n",
      "Emeldirthe Manhearted his wife (whose mind was rather to \n",
      "fight beside her son and her husband than to flee) gathered \n",
      "together all the women and children that were left, and gave \n",
      "arms to those that would bear them; and she led them into \n",
      "the mountains that lay behind, and so by perilous paths, \n",
      "until they came at last with loss and misery to Brethil. Some \n",
      "were there received among the Haladin, but some passed \n",
      "on over the mountains to Dor-lomin and the people of \n",
      "Galdor, Hador's son; and among those were Rian, daughter \n",
      "of Belegund, and Morwen, who was named Eledhwen, that \n",
      "is Elf-sheen, daughter of Baragund. But none ever saw \n",
      "again the men that they had left. For these were slain one \n",
      "by one, until at last only twelve men remained to Barahir; \n",
      "Beren his son, and Baragund and Belegund his nephews, \n",
      "the sons of Bregolas, and nine faithful servants of his house \n",
      "whose names were long remembered in the songs of the \n",
      "Noldor: Radhruin and Dairuin they were, Dagnir and \n",
      "Ragnor, Gildor and Gorlim the unhappy, Arthad and Urthel, \n",
      "and Hathaldir the young. Outlaws without hope they \n",
      "became, a desperate band that could not escape and \n",
      "would not yield, for their dwellings were destroyed, and their \n",
      "wives and children captured, slain, or fled. From Hithlum \n",
      "there came neither news nor help, and Barahir and his men \n",
      "were hunted like wild beasts; and they retreated to the \n",
      "barren highland above the forest, and wandered among the \n",
      "tarns and rocky moors of that region, furthest from the spies \n",
      "and spells of Morgoth. Their bed was the heather and their \n",
      "roof the cloudy sky. \n",
      "\n",
      "For nigh on two years after the Dagor Bragollach the \n",
      "Noldor still defended the western pass about the sources of \n",
      "Sirion, for the power of Ulmo was in that water, and Minas \n",
      "Tirith withstood the Ores. But at length, after the fall of \n",
      "Fingolfin, Sauron, greatest and most terrible of the servants \n",
      "of Morgoth, who in the Sindarin tongue was named \n",
      "Gorthaur, came against Orodreth, the warden of the tower \n",
      "upon Tol Sirion. Sauron was become now a sorcerer of \n",
      "dreadful power, master of shadows and of phantoms, foul \n",
      "in wisdom, cruel in strength, misshaping what he touched, \n",
      "twisting what he ruled, lord of werewolves; his dominion \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "was torment. He took Minas Tirith by assault, for a dark \n",
      "cloud of fear fell upon those that defended it; and Orodreth \n",
      "was driven out, and fled to Nargothrond. Then Sauron \n",
      "made it into a watchtower for Morgoth, a stronghold of evil, \n",
      "and a menace; and the fair isle of Tol Sirion became \n",
      "accursed, and it was called Tol-in-Gaurhoth, the Isle of \n",
      "Werewolves. No living creature could pass through that vale \n",
      "that Sauron did not espy from the tower where he sat. And \n",
      "Morgoth held now the western pass, and his terror filled the \n",
      "fields and woods of Beleriand. Beyond Hithlum he pursued \n",
      "his foes relentlessly, and he searched out their hiding- \n",
      "places and took their strongholds one by one. The Ores \n",
      "growing ever bolder wandered at will far and wide, coming \n",
      "down Sirion in the west and Colon in the east, and they \n",
      "encompassed Doriath; and they harried the lands so that \n",
      "beast and bird fled before them, and silence and \n",
      "desolation spread steadily from the North. Many of the \n",
      "Noldor and the Sindar they took captive and led to \n",
      "Angband, and made them thralls, forcing them to use their \n",
      "skill and their knowledge in the service of Morgoth. And \n",
      "Morgoth sent out his spies, and they were clad in false \n",
      "forms and deceit was in their speech; they made lying \n",
      "promises of reward, and with cunning words sought to \n",
      "arouse fear and jealousy among the peoples, accusing \n",
      "their kings and chieftains of greed, and of treachery one to \n",
      "another. And because of the curse of the Kinslaying at \n",
      "Alqualonde these lies were often believed; and indeed as \n",
      "the time darkened they had a measure of truth, for the \n",
      "hearts and minds of the Elves of Beleriand became \n",
      "clouded with despair and fear. But ever the Noldor feared \n",
      "most the treachery of those of their own kin, who had been \n",
      "thralls in Angband; for Morgoth used some of these for his \n",
      "evil purposes, and feigning to give them liberty sent them \n",
      "abroad, but their wills were chained to his, and they strayed \n",
      "only to come back to him again. Therefore if any of his \n",
      "captives escaped in truth, and returned to their own people, \n",
      "they had little welcome, and wandered alone outlawed and \n",
      "desperate. \n",
      "\n",
      "To Men Morgoth feigned pity, if any would hearken to \n",
      "his messages, saying that their woes came only of their \n",
      "servitude to the rebel Noldor, but at the hands of the rightful \n",
      "Lord of Middle-earth they would get honour and a just \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "reward of valour, if they would leave rebellion. But few men \n",
      "of the Three Houses of the Edain would give ear to him, not \n",
      "even were they brought to the torment of Angband. \n",
      "Therefore Morgoth pursued them with hatred; and he sent \n",
      "his messengers over the mountains. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is told that at this time the Swarthy Men came first \n",
      "into Beleriand. Some were already secretly under the \n",
      "dominion of Morgoth, and came at his call; but not all, for \n",
      "the rumour of Beleriand, of its lands and waters, of its wars \n",
      "and riches, went now far and wide, and the wandering feet \n",
      "of Men were ever set westward in those days. These Men \n",
      "were short and broad, long and strong in the arm; their \n",
      "skins were swart or sallow, and their hair was dark as were \n",
      "their eyes. Their houses were many, and some had greater \n",
      "liking for the Dwarves of the mountains than for the Elves. \n",
      "But Maedhros, knowing the weakness of the Noldor and the \n",
      "Edain, whereas the pits of Angband seemed to hold store \n",
      "inexhaustible and ever-renewed, made alliance with these \n",
      "new-come Men, and gave his friendship to the greatest of \n",
      "their chieftains, Bor and Ulfang. And Morgoth was well \n",
      "content; for this was as he had designed. The sons of Bor \n",
      "were Borlad, Borlach, and Borthand; and they followed \n",
      "Maedhros and Maglor, and cheated the hope of Morgoth, \n",
      "and were faithful. The sons of Ulfang the Black were Ulfast, \n",
      "and Ulwarth, and Uldor the accursed; and they followed \n",
      "Caranthir and swore allegiance to him, and proved \n",
      "faithless. \n",
      "\n",
      "There was small love between the Edain and the \n",
      "Easterlings, and they met seldom; for the newcomers \n",
      "abode long in East Beleriand, but Hador's folk were shut in \n",
      "Hithlum, and Beer's house was well-nigh destroyed. The \n",
      "People of Haleth were at first untouched by the northern \n",
      "war, for they dwelt to the southward in the Forest of Brethil; \n",
      "but now there was battle between them and the invading \n",
      "Ores, for they were stout-hearted men and would not lightly \n",
      "forsake the woods that they loved. And amid the tale of \n",
      "defeats of that time the deeds of the Haladin are \n",
      "remembered with honour: for after the taking of Minas Tirith \n",
      "the Ores came through the western pass, and maybe would \n",
      "have ravaged even to the mouths of Sirion; but Halmir lord \n",
      "of the Haladin sent swift word to Thingol, for he had \n",
      "friendship with the Elves that guarded the borders of \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Doriath. Then Beleg Strongbow, chief of the march- \n",
      "wardens of Thingol, brought great strength of the Sindar \n",
      "armed with axes into Brethil; and issuing from the deeps of \n",
      "the forest Halmir and Beleg took an Ore-legion at unawares \n",
      "and destroyed it. Thereafter the black tide out of the North \n",
      "was stemmed in that region, and the Ores dared not cross \n",
      "the Teiglin for many years after. The People of Haleth dwelt \n",
      "yet in watchful peace in the Forest of Brethil, and behind \n",
      "their guard the Kingdom of Nargothrond had respite, and \n",
      "mustered its strength. \n",
      "\n",
      "At this time Hurin and Huor, the sons of Galdor of Dor- \n",
      "lomin, were dwelling with the Haladin, for they were akin. In \n",
      "the days before the Dagor Bragollach those two houses of \n",
      "the Edam were joined at a great feast, when Galdor and \n",
      "Gloredhel the children of Hador Goldenhead were wedded \n",
      "to Hareth and Haldir the children of Halmir lord of the \n",
      "Haladin. Thus it was that the sons of Galdor were fostered \n",
      "in Brethil by Haldir their uncle, according to the custom of \n",
      "Men in that time; and they went both to that battle with the \n",
      "Ores, even Huor, for he would not be restrained, though he \n",
      "was but thirteen years old. But being with a company that \n",
      "was cut off from the rest they were pursued to the Ford of \n",
      "Brithiach, and there they would have been taken or slain but \n",
      "for the power of Ulmo, that was still strong in Sirion. A mist \n",
      "arose from the river and hid them from their enemies, and \n",
      "they escaped over the Brithiach into Dimbar, and \n",
      "wandered among the hills beneath the sheer walls of the \n",
      "Crissaegrim, until they were bewildered in the deceits of \n",
      "that land and knew not the way to go on or to return. There \n",
      "Thorondor espied them, and he sent two of his eagles to \n",
      "their aid; and the eagles bore them up and brought them \n",
      "beyond the Encircling Mountains to the secret vale of \n",
      "Tumladen and the hidden city of Gondolin, which no Man \n",
      "yet had seen. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There Turgon the King received them well, when he \n",
      "learned of their kin; for messages and dreams had come to \n",
      "him up Sirion from the sea, from Ulmo, Lord of Waters, \n",
      "warning him of woe to come and counselling him to deal \n",
      "kindly with the sons of the house of Hador, from whom help \n",
      "should come to him at need. Hurin and Huor dwelt as \n",
      "guests in the King's house for well nigh a year; and it is said \n",
      "that in this time Hurin learned much lore of the Elves, and \n",
      "understood also something of the counsels and purposes \n",
      "of the King. For Turgon took great liking for the sons of \n",
      "Galdor, and spoke much with them; and he wished indeed \n",
      "to keep them in Gondolin out of love, and not only for his \n",
      "law that no stranger, be he Elf or Man, who found the way to \n",
      "the secret kingdom and looked upon the city should ever \n",
      "depart again, until the King should open the leaguer, and \n",
      "the hidden people should come forth. \n",
      "\n",
      "But Hurin and Huor desired to return to their own \n",
      "people and share in the wars and griefs that now beset \n",
      "them. And Hurin said to Turgon: \"Lord, we are but mortal \n",
      "Men, and unlike the Eldar. They may endure for long years \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "awaiting battle with their enemies in some far distant day; \n",
      "but for us the time is short, and our hope and strength soon \n",
      "wither. Moreover we did not find the road to Gondolin, and \n",
      "indeed we do not know surely where this city stands; for we \n",
      "were brought in fear and wonder by the high ways of the air, \n",
      "and in mercy our eyes were veiled.' Then Turgon granted \n",
      "his prayer, and he said: 'By the way that you came you have \n",
      "leave to depart, if Thorondor is willing. I grieve at this \n",
      "parting; yet in a little while, as the Eldar account it, we may \n",
      "meet again.' \n",
      "\n",
      "But Maeglin, the King's sister-son, who was mighty in \n",
      "Gondolin, grieved not at all at their going, though he \n",
      "begrudged them the favour of the King, for he had no love \n",
      "for any of the kindred of Men; and he said to Hurin: 'The \n",
      "King's grace is greater than you know, and the law is \n",
      "become less stem than aforetime; or else no choice would \n",
      "be given you but to abide here to your life's end.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Hurin answered him: The King's grace is great \n",
      "indeed; but if our word is not enough, then we will swear \n",
      "oaths to you.' And the brothers swore never to reveal the \n",
      "counsels of Turgon, and to keep secret an that they had \n",
      "seen in his realm. Then they took their leave, and the \n",
      "eagles coming bore them away by night, and set them \n",
      "down in Dor-lomin before the dawn. Their kinsfolk rejoiced \n",
      "to see them, for messengers from Brethil had reported that \n",
      "they were lost; but they would not declare even to their \n",
      "father where they had been, save that they were rescued in \n",
      "the wilderness by the eagles that brought them home. But \n",
      "Galdor said: Did you then dwell a year in the wild? Or did \n",
      "the eagles house you in their eyries? But you found food \n",
      "and fine raiment, and return as young princes, not as waifs \n",
      "of the wood.' And Hurin answered: 'Be content that we have \n",
      "returned; for only under an oath of silence was this \n",
      "permitted.' Then Galdor questioned them no more, but he \n",
      "and many others guessed at the truth; and in time the \n",
      "strange fortune of Hurin and Huor reached the ears of the \n",

      "Tarn Aeluin were held in reverence, for they were clear and \n",
      "blue by day and by night were a mirror for the stars; and it \n",

      "and his wife gone; whether slain or taken he knew not. Then \n",
      "he fled to Barahir, and of companions his he was the most \n",
      "fierce and desperate; but doubt gnawed his heart, thinking \n",

      "had forsaken her. But even as he cried aloud the light was \n",
      "blown out in the wind; wolves howled, and on his shoulders \n",
      "he felt suddenly the heavy hands of Sauron's hunters. Thus \n",

      "would yield; and being at last worn with pain, and yearning \n",
      "for his wife, he faltered. Then straightaway they brought him \n",
      "into the dreadful presence of Sauron; and Sauron said: 'I \n",
      "hear now that thou wouldst barter with me. What is thy \n",
      "price?' \n",
      "\n",
      "And Gorlim answered that he should find Eilinel again, \n",

      "In this way the hiding of Barahir was revealed, and \n",
      "Morgoth drew his net about it; and the Ores coming in the \n",

      "and slew them all, save one. For Beren son of Barahir had \n",
      "been sent by his father on a perilous errand to spy upon the \n",
      "ways of the Enemy, and he was far afield when the lair was \n",
      "taken. But as he slept benighted in the forest he dreamed \n",

      "beside a mere, and blood dripped from their beaks. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Beren was aware in his dream of a form that \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "the alder-trees beside Tarn Aeluin, and croaked in \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "There Beren buried his fathers bones, and raised a \n",
      "cairn of boulders above him, and swore upon it an oath of \n",
      "vengeance. First there for he pursued the Ores that had \n",
      "slain his father and his kinsmen, and he found their camp \n",
      "by night at Rivil's Well above the Fen of Serech, and \n",
      "because of his wood craft he came near to their fire \n",
      "unseen. There their captain made boast of his deeds, and \n",
      "he held up the hand of Barahir that he had cut off as a token \n",
      "for Sauron that their mission was fulfilled; and the ring of \n",
      "Felagund was on that hand. Then Beren sprang from \n",
      "behind rock, and slew captain, and taking the hand and the \n",

      "dismayed, and their arrows wild. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thereafter for four years more Beren wandered still \n",

      "friend of birds and beasts, and they aided him, and did not \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "betray him, and from that time forth he ate no flesh nor slew \n",
      "any living thing that was not in the service of Morgoth. He \n",
      "did not fear death, but only captivity, and being bold and \n",
      "desperate he escaped both death and bonds; and the \n",
      "deeds of lonely daring that he achieved were noised \n",
      "abroad throughout Beleriand, and the tail of them came \n",
      "even into Doriath. At length Morgoth set a price upon his \n",
      "head no less than the price upon the head of Fingon, High \n",
      "King of the Noldor; but the Ores fled rather at the rumour of \n",
      "his approach than sought him out. Therefore and army was \n",
      "sent against him under the command of Sauron; and \n",
      "Sauron brought werewolves, fell beasts inhabited by \n",
      "dreadful spirits that he had imprisoned in their bodies. \n",
      "\n",
      "All that land was now become filled with evil, and all \n",

      "Dorthonion. In time of winter and snow he forsook the land \n",
      "and grave of his father, and climbing into the high land of \n",
      "Doriath. There it was put into his heart that he would go \n",
      "down into the Hidden Kingdom, where no mortal foot had \n",
      "trodden. Terrible was his southward journey. Sheer were \n",
      "the precipices of Ered Gorgoroth, and beneath their feet \n",
      "were shadows that were laid before the rising of the Moon. \n",
      "Beyond lay the wilderness of Dungortheb, where the \n",
      "sorcery of Sauron and the power of Melian came together, \n",
      "and horror and madness walked. There spiders of the fell \n",
      "race of Ungoliant abode, spinning their unseen webs in \n",
      "which all living things were snared; and monsters wandered \n",
      "there that were born in the long dark before the Sun, hunting \n",
      "silently with many eyes. No food for Elves or Men was there \n",
      "in that haunted land, but death only. That journey is not \n",
      "accounted least among the great deeds of Beren, but he \n",
      "spoke of it to no one after, lest the horror return into his \n",
      "mind; and none know how he found a way, and so came by \n",
      "paths that no Man nor Elf else ever dared to tread to the \n",
      "borders of Doriath. And he passed through the mazes that \n",

      "had foretold; for a great doom lay upon him. \n",
      "\n",

      "wandering in the summer in the woods of Neldoreth he \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "came upon Luthien, daughter of Thingol and Melian, at a \n",
      "time of evening under moonrise, as she danced upon the \n",
      "unfading grass in the glades beside Esgalduin. Then all \n",
      "memory of his pain departed from him, and he fell into an \n",
      "enchantment; for Luthien was the most beautiful of all the \n",
      "Children of lluvatar. Blue was her raiment as the unclouded \n",
      "heaven, but her eyes were grey as the starlit evening; her \n",
      "mantle was sewn with golden flowers, but her hair was dark \n",
      "as the shadows of twilight. As the light upon the leaves of \n",
      "trees, as the voice of clear waters, as the stars above the \n",
      "mists of the world, such was her glory and her loveliness; \n",
      "and in her face was a shining light. \n",
      "\n",
      "But she vanished from his sight; and he became \n",
      "dumb, as one that is bound under a spell, and he strayed \n",
      "long in the woods, wild and wary as a beast, seeking for \n",
      "her. In his heart he called her Tinuviel, that signifies \n",
      "Nightingale, daughter of twilight, in the Grey-elven tongue, \n",
      "for he knew no other name for her. And he saw her afar as \n",
      "leaves in the winds of autumn, and in winter as a star upon \n",
      "a hill, but a chain was upon his limbs. \n",
      "\n",
      "There came a time near dawn on the eve of spring, \n",
      "and Luthien danced upon a green hill; and suddenly she \n",
      "began to sing. Keen, heart-piercing was her song as the \n",
      "song of the lark that rises from the gates of night and pours \n",
      "its voice among the dying stars, seeing the sun behind the \n",
      "walls of the world; and the song of Luthien released the \n",
      "behind the walls of the world; and the song of Luthien \n",
      "released the bonds of winter, and the frozen waters spoke, \n",
      "and flowers sprang from the cold earth where her feet had \n",
      "passed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the spell of silence fell from Beren, and he called \n",
      "to her, crying Tinuviel; and the woods echoed the name. \n",
      "Then she halted in wonder, and fled no more, and Beren \n",
      "came to her. But as she looked on him, doom fell upon her, \n",
      "and she loved him; yet she slipped from his arms and \n",
      "vanished from his sight even as the day was breaking. \n",
      "Then Beren lay upon the ground in a swoon, as one slain at \n",
      "once by bliss and grief; and he fell into a sleep as it were \n",
      "into an abyss of shadow, and waking he was cold as stone, \n",
      "and his heart barren and forsaken. And wandering in mind \n",
      "he groped as one that is stricken with sudden blindness, \n",
      "and seeks with hands to grasp the vanished light. Thus he \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "began the payment of anguish for the fate that was laid on \n",
      "him; and in his fate Luthien was caught, and being immortal \n",
      "she shared in his mortality, and being free received his \n",
      "chain; and her anguish was greater than any other of the \n",
      "Eldalie has known. \n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond his hope she returned to him where he sat in \n",
      "darkness, and long ago in the Hidden Kingdom she laid her \n",
      "hand in his. Thereafter often she came to him, and they \n",
      "went in secret through the woods together from spring to \n",
      "summer; and no others of the Children of lluvatar have had \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But Daeron the minstrel also loved Luthien, and he \n",
      "espied her meetings with Beren, and betrayed them to \n",
      "Thingol. Then the King was filled with anger, for Luthien he \n",
      "loved above all things, setting her above all the princes of \n",
      "the Elves; whereas mortal Men he did not even take into his \n",
      "service. Therefore he spoke in grief and amazement to \n",
      "Luthien; but she would reveal nothing, until he swore an \n",
      "oath to her that he would neither slay Beren nor imprison \n",
      "him. But he sent his servants to lay hands on him and lead \n",
      "him to Menegroth as a malefactor; and Luthien forestalling \n",
      "them led Beren herself before the throne of Thingol, as if he \n",
      "were an honoured guest. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Thingol looked upon Beren in scorn and anger; \n",
      "but Melian was silent. 'Who are you', said the King, 'that \n",
      "come hither as a thief, and unbidden dare to approach my \n",
      "throne?' \n",
      "\n",
      "But Beren being filled with dread, for the splendour of \n",
      "Menegroth and the majesty of Thingol were very great, \n",
      "answered nothing. Therefore Luthien spoke, and said: 'He \n",
      "is Beren son of Barahir, lord of Men, mighty foe of Morgoth, \n",
      "the tale of whose deeds is become a song even among the \n",
      "Elves.' \n",
      "\n",
      "'Let Beren speak!' said Thingol. 'What would you here, \n",
      "unhappy mortal, and for what cause have you left your own \n",
      "land to enter this, which is forbidden to such as you? Can \n",
      "you show reason why my power should not be laid on you in \n",
      "heavy punishment for you insolence and folly?' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Beren looking up beheld the eyes of Luthien, and \n",
      "his glance went also to the face of Melian and it seemed to \n",
      "him that words were put into his mouth. Fear left him, and \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the pride of the eldest house of Men returned to him; and he \n",
      "said; 'My fate, O King, led me hither, through perils such as \n",
      "few even of the Elves would dare. And here I have found \n",
      "what I sought not indeed, but finding I would possess for \n",
      "ever. For it is above all gold and silver, and beyond all \n",
      "jewels. Neither rock, nor steel, nor the fires of Morgoth, nor \n",
      "all the powers of the Elf-kingdoms, shall keep from me the \n",
      "treasure that I desire. For Luthien your daughter is the \n",
      "fairest of all the Children of the World.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then silence fell upon the hall, for those that stood \n",
      "there were astounded and afraid, and they thought that \n",
      "Beren would be slain. But Thingol spoke slowly, saying: \n",
      "'Death you have earned with these words; and death you \n",
      "should find suddenly, had I not sworn an oath in haste; of \n",
      "which I repent, baseborn mortal, who in the realm of \n",
      "Morgoth has learnt to creep in secret as his spies and \n",
      "thralls.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Beren answered: 'Death you can give me earned \n",
      "or unearned; but the names I will not take from you of \n",
      "baseborn, nor spy, nor thrall. By the ring of Felagund, that \n",
      "he gave to Barahir my father on the battle field of the North, \n",
      "my house has not earned such names from any Elf, be he \n",
      "king or no.' \n",
      "\n",
      "His words were proud, and all eyes looked upon the \n",
      "ring; for he held it now aloft, and the green jewels gleamed \n",
      "there that the Noldor had devised in Valinor. For this ring \n",
      "was like to twin serpents, whose eyes were emeralds, and \n",
      "their heads met beneath a crown of golden flowers, that the \n",
      "one upheld and the other devoured; that was the badge of \n",
      "Finarfin and his house; Then Melian leaned to Thingol's \n",
      "side, and in whispered counsel bade him forgo his wrath. \n",
      "'For not by you,' she said, 'shall Beren be slain; and far and \n",
      "free does his fate led him in the end, yet it is wound with \n",
      "yours. Take heed!' \n",
      "\n",
      "But Thingol looked in silence upon Luthien; and he \n",
      "thought in his heart: 'Unhappy Men, children of little lords \n",
      "and brief kings, shall such as these lay hands on you, and \n",
      "yet live?' Then breaking the silence he said: 'I see the ring, \n",
      "son of Barahir, and I perceive that you are proud, and deem \n",
      "yourself mighty. But a father's deeds, even had his service \n",
      "been rendered to me, avail not to win the daughter of \n",
      "Thingol and Melian. See now! I too desire a treasure that is \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "withheld. For rock and steel and the fires of Morgoth keep \n",
      "the jewel that I would possess against all the powers of the \n",
      "Elf-kingdoms. Yet I hear you say that bonds such as these \n",
      "do not daunt you. Go your way therefore! Bring to me in \n",
      "your hand a Silmaril from Morgoth's crown; and then, if she \n",
      "will, Luthien may set her hand in yours. Then you shall have \n",
      "my jewel; and though the fate of Arda lie within the \n",
      "Silmarils, yet you shall hold me generous.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus he wrought the doom of Doriath, and was \n",
      "ensnared within the curse of Mandos. And those that heard \n",
      "these words perceived that Thingol would save his oath, \n",
      "and yet send Beren to his death; for they know that not all \n",
      "the power of the Noldor, before the Siege was broken, had \n",
      "availed even to see from afar the shining Silmarils of \n",
      "Feanor. For they were set in the Iron Crown, and treasured \n",
      "in Angband above all wealth; and Balrogs were about them, \n",
      "and countless swords, and strong bars, and unassailable \n",
      "walls, and the dark majesty of Morgoth. \n",
      "\n",
      "But Beren laughed. 'For little price,' he said, 'do Elven- \n",
      "kings sell their daughters: for gems, and things made by \n",
      "craft. But if this be your will, Thingol, I will perform it. And \n",
      "when we meet again my hand shall hold a Silmaril from the \n",
      "Iron Crown; for you have not looked the last upon Beren son \n",
      "of Barahir.' Then he looked in the eyes of Melian, who \n",
      "spoke not; and he bade farewell to Luthien Tnuviel, and \n",
      "bowing before Thingol and Melian he put aside the guards \n",
      "about him, and departed from Menegroth alone. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then at last Melian spoke, and she said to Thingol: 'O \n",
      "King, you have devised cunning counsel. But if my eyes \n",
      "have not lost their sight, it is ill for you, whether Beren fail in \n",
      "his errand, or achieve it. For you have doom either your \n",
      "daughter, or yourself. And now is Doriath drawn within the \n",
      "fate of a mightier realm.' But Thingol answered: 'I sell not to \n",
      "Elves or Men those whom I love and cherish above all \n",
      "treasure. And if there were hope or fear that Beren should \n",
      "come ever back alive to Menegroth, he should not have \n",
      "looked again upon the light of heaven, though I had sworn \n",
      "it.' \n",
      "\n",
      "But Luthien was silent, and from that hour she sang not \n",
      "again in Doriath. A brooding silence fell upon the woods, \n",
      "and the shadows lengthened in the kingdom of Thingol. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It is told in the Lay of Leithian that Beren passed \n",
      "through Doriath unhindered, and came at length to the \n",
      "region of the Twilight Meres, and the Fens of Sirion; and \n",
      "leaving Thingol's land he climbed the hills above the Falls of \n",
      "Sirion, where the river plunged underground with great \n",
      "noise. Thence he looked westward, and through the mist \n",
      "and rains that lay upon those hills he saw Talath Dirnen, the \n",
      "Guarded Plain, stretching between Sirion and Narog; and \n",
      "beyond he descried afar the highlands of Taur-en-Faroth \n",
      "that rose above Nargothrond. And being destitute, without \n",
      "hope or counsel, he turned his feet thither. \n",
      "\n",
      "Upon all that plain the Elves of Nargothrond kept \n",
      "unceasing watch; and every hill upon its borders was \n",
      "crowned with hidden towers, and through all its woods and \n",
      "fields archers ranged secretly and with great craft. Their \n",
      "arrows were sure and deadly, and nothing crept there \n",
      "against their will. Therefore, ere Beren had come far upon \n",
      "his road, they were aware of him, and his death was nigh. \n",
      "But knowing his danger he held ever aloft the ring of \n",
      "Felagund; and though he saw no living thing, because of \n",
      "the stealth of the hunters, he felt that he was watched, and \n",
      "cried often aloud: 'I am Beren son of Barahir, friend of \n",
      "Felagund. Take me to the King!' Therefore the hunters slew \n",
      "him not, but assembling they waylaid him, and commanded \n",
      "him to halt. But seeing the ring they bowed before him, \n",
      "though he was in evil plight, wild and wayworn; and they led \n",
      "hi northward and westward, going by night lest their paths \n",
      "should be revealed. For at that time there was no ford or \n",
      "bridge over the torrent of Narog before the gates of \n",
      "Nargothrond; but further to the north, where Ginglith joined \n",
      "Narog, the flood was less, and crossing there and turning \n",
      "again southward the Elves led Beren under the light of the \n",
      "moon to the dark gates of their hidden halls. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus Beren came before King Finrod Felagund; and \n",
      "Felagund knew him, needing no ring to remind him of the \n",
      "kin of Beor and of Barahir. Behind closed doors they sat, \n",
      "and Beren told of the death of Barahir, and of all that had \n",
      "befallen hi in Doriath; and he wept, recalling Luthien and \n",
      "their joy together. But Felagund heard his tale in wonder \n",
      "and disquiet; and he knew that the oath he had sworn was \n",
      "come upon him for his death, as long before he had \n",
      "foretold to Galadriel. He spoke then to Beren in heaviness \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "of heart. 'It is plain that Thingol desires your death; but it \n",
      "seems that this doom goes beyond his purpose, and that \n",
      "the Oath of Feanor is again at work. For the Silmarils are \n",
      "cursed with an oath of hatred, and he that even names them \n",
      "in desire moves a great power from slumber; and the sons \n",
      "of Feanor would lay all the Elf-kingdoms in ruin rather than \n",
      "suffer any other than themselves to win or possess a \n",
      "Silmaril, for the Oath drives them. And now Celegorm and \n",
      "Curufin are dwelling in my halls; and though I, Finarfin's son, \n",
      "am King, they have won a strong power in the realm, and \n",
      "lead many of their own people. They have shown friendship \n",
      "to me in every need, but I fear that they will show neither \n",
      "love nor mercy to you, if your quest be told. Yet my own oath \n",
      "holds; and thus we are all ensnared.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then King Felagund spoke before his people, \n",
      "recalling the deeds of Barahir, and his vow and he declared \n",
      "that it was laid upon him to aid the son of Barahir in his \n",
      "need, and he sought the help of his chieftains. Then \n",
      "Celegorm arose amid the throng, and drawing his sword he \n",
      "cried: 'Be he friend or foe, whether demon of Morgoth, of \n",
      "Elf, or child of Men, or any other living thing in Arda, neither \n",
      "law, nor love, nor league of hell, nor might of the Valar, nor \n",
      "any power of wizardry, shall defend him from the pursuing \n",
      "hate of Feanor's sons, if he take or find a Silmaril and keep \n",
      "it. For the Silmarils we alone claim, until the world ends.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Many other words he spoke, as potent as were long \n",
      "before in Tirion the words of his father that first inflamed the \n",
      "Noldor to rebellion. And after Celegorm Curufin spoke, \n",
      "more softly but with no less power, conjuring in the minds of \n",
      "the Elves a vision of war and the ruin of Nargothrond. So \n",
      "great a fear did he set in their hearts that never after until \n",
      "the time of Turin would any Elf of that realm go into open \n",
      "battle; but with stealth and ambush, with wizardry and \n",
      "venomed dart, they pursued all strangers, forgetting the \n",
      "bonds of kinship. Thus they fell from the valour and freedom \n",
      "of the Elves of old, and their land was darkened. \n",
      "\n",
      "And now they murmured that Finarfin's son was not as \n",
      "a Vala to command them, and they turned their faces from \n",
      "him. But the curse of Mandos came upon the brothers, and \n",
      "dark thoughts arose in their hearts, thinking to send forth \n",
      "Felagund alone to his death, and to usurp, it might be, the \n",
      "throne of Nargothrond; for they were of the eldest line of the \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "princes of the Noldor. \n",
      "\n",
      "And Felagund seeing that he was forsaken took from \n",
      "his head the silver crown of Nargothrond and cast it at his \n",
      "feet, saying: 'Your oaths of faith to me you may break, but I \n",
      "must hold my bond. Yet if there be any on whom the \n",
      "shadow of out curse has not yet fallen, I should find at least \n",
      "a few to follow me, and should not go hence as a beggar \n",
      "that is thrust from the gates.' There were ten that stood by \n",
      "him; and the chief of them, who was named Edrahil, \n",
      "stooping lifted the crown and asked that it be given to a \n",
      "steward until Felagund's return, 'for you remain my king, \n",
      "and theirs,' he said, 'whatever betide.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Felagund gave the crown of Nargothrond to \n",
      "Orodreth his brother to govern in his stead; and Celegorm \n",
      "and Curufin said nothing, but they smiled and went from the \n",
      "halls. \n",
      "\n",
      "On an evening of autumn Felagund and Beren set out \n",
      "from Nargothrond with their ten companions; and they \n",
      "journeyed beside Narog to his source in the Falls of Ivrin. \n",
      "Beneath the Shadowy Mountains they came upon a \n",
      "company of Ores, and slew them all in their camp by night; \n",
      "and they took their gear and their weapons. By the arts of \n",
      "Felagund their own forms and faces were changed into the \n",
      "likeness of Ores; and thus disguised they came far upon \n",
      "their northward road, and ventured into the western pass, \n",
      "between Ered Wethrin and the highlands of Taur-nu-Fuin. \n",
      "But Sauron in his tower was ware of them, and doubt took \n",
      "him; for they went in haste, and stayed not to report their \n",
      "deeds, as was commanded to all the servants of Morgoth \n",
      "that passed that way. Therefore he sent to waylay them, \n",
      "and bring them before him. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus befell the contest of Sauron and Felagund which \n",
      "is renowned. For Felagund strove with Sauron in songs of \n",
      "power, ad the power of the King was very great; but Sauron \n",
      "had the mastery, as is told in the Lay of Leithian: \n",
      "\n",
      "He chanted a song of wizardry, \n",
      "\n",
      "Of piercing, opening, of treachery, \n",
      "\n",
      "Revealing, uncovering, betraying. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then sudden Felagund there swaying, \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Sang in a song of staying, \n",
      "\n",
      "Resisting, battling against power, \n",
      "\n",
      "Of secrets kept, strength like a tower, \n",
      "\n",
      "And trust unbroken, freedom, escape; \n",
      "\n",
      "Of changing and shifting shape, \n",
      "\n",
      "Of snares eluded, broken traps, \n",
      "\n",
      "The prison opening, the chain that snaps. \n",
      "\n",
      "Backwards and forwards swayed their song. \n",
      "Reeling foundering, as ever more strong \n",
      "The chanting swelled, Felagund fought, \n",
      "\n",
      "And all the magic and might he brought \n",
      "Of Elvenesse into his words. \n",
      "\n",
      "Softly in the gloom they heard the birds \n",
      "Singing afar in Nargothrond, \n",
      "\n",
      "The sighting of the Sea beyond, \n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond the western world, on sand, \n",
      "\n",
      "On sand of pearls on Elvenland. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then in the doom gathered; darkness growing \n",
      "In Valinor, the red blood flowing \n",
      "Beside the Sea, where the Noldor slew \n",
      "The Foamriders, and stealing drew \n",
      "\n",
      "Their white ships with their white sails \n",
      "From lamplit havens. The wind wails, \n",
      "\n",
      "The wolf howls. The ravens flee. \n",
      "\n",
      "The ice mutters in the mouths of the Sea. \n",
      "\n",
      "The captives sad in Angband mourn. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thunder rumbles, the fires burn- \n",
      "And Finrod fell before the throne. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Sauron stripped from the their disguise, and they \n",
      "stood before him naked and afraid. But though their kinds \n",
      "were revealed, Sauron could not discover their names or \n",
      "their purposes. \n",
      "\n",
      "He cast them therefore into a deep pit, dark and silent, \n",
      "and threatened to slay them cruel, unless one would betray \n",
      "the truth to him. From time to time they saw two eyes \n",
      "kindled in the dark, and a werewolf devoured one of the \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "companions; but none betrayed their lord. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the time when Sauron cast Beren into the pit a \n",
      "weight of horror came upon Luthien's heart; and going to \n",
      "Melian for counsel she learned that Beren lay in the \n",
      "dungeons of Tol-in-Gaurhoth without hope of rescue. Then \n",
      "Luthien, perceiving that no help would come from any other \n",
      "on earth, resolved to fly from Doriath and come herself to \n",
      "him; but she sought the aid of Daeron, and he betrayed her \n",
      "purpose because he would not deprive Luthien of the lights \n",
      "of heaven, lest she fail and fade, and yet would restrain her, \n",
      "he caused a house to be built from which she should not \n",
      "escape. Not far from the gates of Menegroth stood the \n",
      "greatest of all the trees in the Forest of Neldoreth; and that \n",
      "was a beech-forest and the northern half of the kingdom. \n",
      "This mighty beech was named Hirilorn, and it had three \n",
      "trunks, equal in girth, smooth in rind, and exceeding tall; no \n",
      "branches grew from them for a great height above the \n",
      "ground. Far aloft between the shafts of Hirilorn a wooden \n",
      "house was built, and there Luthien was made to dwell; and \n",
      "ladders were taken away and guarded, save only when the \n",
      "servants of Thingol wrought her such things as she needed. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is told in the Lay of Leithian how she escaped from \n",
      "the house in Hirilorn; for she put forth her arts of \n",
      "enchantment, and caused her hair to grow to great length, \n",
      "and of it she wove a dark robe that wrapped her beauty like \n",
      "a shadow, and it was laden with a spell of sleep. Of the \n",
      "strands that remained she twined a rope, and she let it \n",
      "down from her window; and as the end swayed above the \n",
      "guards that sat beneath the house they fell into a deep \n",
      "slumber. Then Luthien climbed from her prison, and \n",
      "shrouded in her shadowy cloak she escaped from all eyes, \n",
      "and vanished out of Doriath. \n",
      "\n",
      "It chanced that Celegorm and Curufin went on a hunt \n",
      "through the Guarded Plain; and this they did because \n",
      "Sauron, being filled with suspicion, sent forth many wolves \n",
      "into the Elf-lands. Therefore they took their hounds and \n",
      "rode forth; and they thought that ere they returned they \n",
      "might also hear tidings concerning King Felagund. Now the \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "chief of the wolf hounds that followed Celegorm was named \n",
      "Huan. He was not born in Middle-earth, but came from the \n",
      "Blessed Realm; for Orome had given him to Celegorm long \n",
      "ago in Valinor, and there he had followed the horn of his \n",
      "master, before evil came. Huan followed Celegorm into \n",
      "exile, and was faithful; and thus he too came under the \n",
      "doom of woe set upon the Noldor, and it was decreed that \n",
      "he should meet death, but not until he encountered the \n",
      "mightiest wolf that would ever walk the world. \n",
      "\n",
      "Huan it was that found Luthien flying like a shadow \n",
      "surprised by the daylight under the trees, when Celegorm \n",
      "and Curufin rested a while near to the western eaves of \n",
      "Doriath; for nothing could escape the sight and scent of \n",
      "Huan, nor could any enchantment stay him, and he slept \n",
      "not, neither by night nor day. He brought her to Celegorm, \n",
      "and Luthien, learning that he was a prince of the Noldor and \n",
      "a foe of Morgoth, was glad; and she declared herself, \n",
      "casting aside her cloak. So great was her sudden beauty \n",
      "revealed beneath the sun that Celegorm became \n",
      "enamoured of her; but he spoke her fair, and promised that \n",
      "she would find help in her need, if she returned with him \n",
      "now to Nargothrond. By no sign did he reveal that he knew \n",
      "already of Beren and the quest, of which she told, nor that it \n",
      "was a matter which touched him near. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus they broke off the hunt and returned to \n",
      "Nargothrond, and Luthien was betrayed; for they held her \n",
      "fast, and took away her cloak, and she was not permitted to \n",
      "pass the gates or to speak with any save the brothers, \n",
      "Celegorm and Curufin. For now, believing that Beren and \n",
      "Felagund were prisoners beyond hope of aid, they \n",
      "purposed to let the King perish, and to keep Luthien, and \n",
      "force Thingol to give her the mightiest of princes of the \n",
      "Noldor. And they did not purpose to seek the Silmarils by \n",
      "craft or war, or to suffer any others to do so, until they had \n",
      "all the might of the Elf-kingdoms under their hands. \n",
      "Orodreth had no power to withstand them, for they swayed \n",
      "the hearts of the people of Nargothrond; and Celegorm \n",
      "sent messengers to Thingol urging his suit. \n",
      "\n",
      "But Huan the hound was true of heart, and the love of \n",
      "Luthien had fallen upon him in the first hour of their meeting; \n",
      "and he grieved at her captivity. Therefore he came often to \n",
      "her chamber; and at night he lay before her door, for he felt \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "that evil had come to Nargothrond. Luthien spoke often to \n",
      "Huan in her loneliness, telling of Beren, who was the friend \n",
      "of all birds and beasts that did not serve Morgoth; ad Huan \n",
      "understood all that was said. For he comprehended the \n",
      "speech of all things with voice; but it was permitted to him \n",
      "thrice only ere his death to speak with words. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now Huan devised a plan for the aid of Luthien; and \n",
      "coming at a time of night he brought her cloak, and for the \n",
      "first time he spoke, giving her counsel. Then he led her by \n",
      "secret ways out of Nargothrond, and they fled north \n",
      "together; and he humbled his pride and suffered her to ride \n",
      "upon him in the fashion of a steed, even as the Ores did at \n",
      "times upon great wolves. Thus they made great speed, for \n",
      "Huan was swift and tireless. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the pits of Sauron Beren and Felagund lay, and all \n",
      "their companions were now dead; but Sauron purposed to \n",
      "keep Felagund to the last, for he perceived that he was a \n",
      "Noldo of great might and wisdom, and he deemed that in \n",
      "him lay the secret of their errand. But when the wolf came \n",
      "for Beren, Felagund put forth all his power, and burst his \n",
      "bonds; and he wrestled with the werewolf, and slew it with \n",
      "his hands and teeth; yet he himself was wounded to the \n",
      "death. Then he spoke to Beren, saying: 'I go now to my long \n",
      "rest in the timeless halls beyond the seas and the \n",
      "Mountains of Aman. It will be long ere I am seen among the \n",
      "Noldor again; and it may be that we shall not meet a \n",
      "second time in death or life, for the fates of our kindreds \n",
      "are apart. Farewell!' He died then in the dark, in Tol-in- \n",
      "Gaurhoth, whose great tower he himself had built. Thus \n",
      "King F inrod Felagund, fairest and most beloved of the \n",
      "house of Finwe, redeemed his oath; but Beren mourned \n",
      "beside him in despair. \n",
      "\n",
      "In that hour Luthien came, and standing upon the \n",
      "bridge that led to Sauron's isle she sang a song that no \n",
      "walls of stone could hinder. Beren heard, and he thought \n",
      "that he dreamed; for the stars shone above him, and in the \n",
      "trees nightingales were singing. And in answer he sang a \n",
      "song of challenge that he had made in praise of the Seven \n",
      "Stars, the Sickle of the Valar that Varda hung above the \n",
      "North as a sign for the fall of Morgoth. Then all strength left \n",
      "him and he fell down into darkness. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But Luthien heard his answering voice, and she sang \n",
      "then a song of greater power. The wolves howled, and the \n",
      "isle trembled. Sauron stood in the high tower, wrapped in \n",
      "his black thought ;but he smiled hearing her voice, for he \n",
      "knew that it was the daughter of Melian. The fame of the \n",
      "beauty of Luthien and the wonder of her song had long \n",
      "gone forth from Doriath; and he thought to make her captive \n",
      "and hand her over to the power of Morgoth, for his reward \n",
      "would be great. Therefore he sent a wolf to the bridge. But \n",
      "Huan slew it silently. Still Sauron sent others one by one; \n",
      "and one by one Huan took them by the throat and slew \n",
      "them. Then Sauron sent Draugluin, a dread beast, old in \n",
      "evil lord and sire of the werewolves of Angband. His might \n",
      "was great; and the battle of Huan and Draugluin was long \n",
      "and fierce. Yet at length Draugluin escaped, and fleeing \n",
      "back into the tower he died before Sauron's feet; and as he \n",
      "died he told his master: 'Huan is there!' Now Sauron knew \n",
      "well, as did all in that land, the fate that was decreed for the \n",
      "hound of Valinor, and it came into his thought that he \n",
      "himself would accomplish it. Therefore he took upon \n",
      "himself the form of a werewolf, and made himself the \n",
      "mightiest that had yet walked the world; and he came forth \n",
      "to win the passage of the bridge. \n",
      "\n",
      "So great was the horror of his approach that Huan \n",
      "leaped aside. Then Sauron sprang upon Luthien; and she \n",
      "swooned before the menace of the fell spirit in his eyes and \n",
      "the foul vapour of his breath. But even as he came, falling \n",
      "she cast a fold of her dark cloak before his eyes; and he \n",
      "stumbled, for a fleeting drowsiness came upon him. Then \n",
      "Huan sprang. There befell the battle of Huan and Wolf- \n",
      "Sauron, and howls and baying echoed in the hills, and the \n",
      "watchers on the walls of Ered Wethrin across the valley \n",
      "heard it afar and were dismayed. \n",
      "\n",
      "But no wizardry nor spell, neither fang nor venom, nor \n",
      "devil's art nor beast-strength , could overthrow Huan without \n",
      "forsaking his body utterly. Ere his foul spirit left its dark \n",
      "house, Luthien came to him, ghost be sent quaking back to \n",
      "Morgoth; and she said: 'There everlastingly thy naked self \n",
      "shall endure the torment of his scorn, pierced by his eyes, \n",
      "unless thou yield to me the mastery of thy tower.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Sauron yielded himself, and Luthien took the \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "mastery of the isle and all that was there; and Huan \n",
      "released him. And immediately he took the form of a \n",
      "vampire, great as a dark cloud across the moon, and he \n",
      "fled, dripping blood from his throat upon the trees, and \n",
      "came to Tar-nu-Fuin, and dwelt there, filling it with horror. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Luthien stood upon the bridge, and declare her \n",
      "power: and the spell was loosed that bound stone to stone, \n",
      "and the gates were thrown down, and the walls opened, \n",
      "and the pits laid bare; and many thralls and captives came \n",
      "forth in wonder and dismay, shielding their eyes against the \n",
      "pale moon light, for they had lain long in the darkness of \n",
      "Sauron. But Beren came not. Therefore Huan and Luthien \n",
      "sought him in the isle; and Luthien found him mourning by \n",
      "Felagund. So deep was his anguish that he lay still, and did \n",
      "not hear her feet. Then thinking him already dead she put \n",
      "her arms about him and fell into a dark forgetfulness. But \n",
      "Beren coming back to the light out of the pits of despair \n",
      "lifted her up, and they looked again upon one another; and \n",
      "the day rising over the dark hills shone upon them. \n",
      "\n",
      "They buried the body of Felagund upon the hill-top of \n",
      "his own isle, and it was clean again; and the green grave of \n",
      "Finrod Finarfin's son, fairest of all the princes of the Elves, \n",
      "remained inviolate, until the land was changed and broken, \n",
      "and foundered under destroying seas. But Finrod walks \n",
      "with Finarfin his father beneath the trees in Eldamar. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now Beren and Luthien Tinuviel went free again and \n",
      "together walked through the woods renewing for a time \n",
      "their joy; and though winter came it hurt them not, for flowers \n",
      "lingered where Luthien went, and the birds sang beneath \n",
      "the snow clad hills. But Huan being faithful went back to \n",
      "Celegorm his master; yet their love was less than before. \n",
      "\n",
      "There was tumult in Nargothrond. For thither now \n",
      "returned many Elves that had been prisoners in the isle of \n",
      "Sauron; and a clamour arose that no words of Celegorm \n",
      "could still. They lamented bitterly the fall of Felagund their \n",
      "king, saying that a maiden had dared that which the sons of \n",
      "Feanor had not dared to do; but many perceived that it was \n",
      "treachery rather than fear that had guided Celegorm and \n",
      "Curufin. There fore the hearts of the people of Nargothrond \n",
      "were released from their dominion, and turned again to the \n",
      "house of Finarfin; and they obeyed Orodreth. But he would \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "not suffer them to slay the brothers, as some desired, for \n",
      "the spilling of kindred blood by kin would bind the cures of \n",
      "Mandos more closely upon them all. Yet neither bread nor \n",
      "rest would he grant to Celegorm and Curufin within his \n",
      "realm, and he swore that there should be little love between \n",
      "Nargothrond and the sons of Feanor there after. \n",
      "\n",
      "'Let it be so!' said Celegorm, and there was a light of \n",
      "menace in his eyes; but Curufin smiled. Ten they took horse \n",
      "and rode away like fire, to find if they might their kindred in \n",
      "the east. But none would go with them, not even those that \n",
      "were of their own people; for all perceived that the curse lay \n",
      "heavily upon the brothers, and that evil followed them. In that \n",
      "time Celebrimbor the son of Curufin repudiated the deeds \n",
      "of his father, and remained in Nargothrond; yet Huan \n",
      "followed still the horse of Celegorm his master. \n",
      "\n",
      "Northward they rode, for they intended in their haste to \n",
      "pass through Dimbar, and along the north marches or \n",
      "Doriath, seeking the swiftest road to Him ring, where \n",
      "Maedhros their brother dwelt; and still they might hope with \n",
      "speed to traverse it, since it lay close to Doriath's borders, \n",
      "shunning Nan Dungortheb and the distant menace of the \n",
      "Mountains of Terror. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now it is told that Beren and Luthien came in their \n",
      "wandering into the Forests of Brethil, and drew near at last \n",
      "to the borders of Doriath. Then Beren took thought of his \n",
      "vow; and against his heart he resolved, when Luthien was \n",
      "come again within the safety of her own land, to set forth \n",
      "once more. But she was not willing to be parted form him \n",
      "again, saying: 'You must choose, Beren, between these \n",
      "two: to relinquish the quest and your oath and seek a life of \n",
      "wandering upon the face of the earth; or to hold to your \n",
      "word and challenge the power of darkness upon its throne. \n",
      "But on either road I shall go with you, and our doom shall be \n",
      "alike.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Even as they spoke together of these things, walking \n",
      "without heed of aught else, Celegorm and Curufin rode up, \n",
      "hastening through the forest; and the brothers espied them \n",
      "and knew them for afar. Then Celegorm turned his horse, \n",
      "and spurred it upon Beren, purposing to ride him down; but \n",
      "Curufin swerving stooped and lifted Luthien to his saddle, \n",
      "for he was a strong and cunning horseman. Then Beren \n",
      "sprang from before Celegorm full upon the speeding horse \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "of Curufin that had passed hi; and the Leap of Beren is \n",
      "renowned among that had passed him; and the Leap of \n",
      "Beren is renowned among Men and Elves. He took Curufin \n",
      "by the throat from behind, and hurled him backward, and \n",
      "they fell to the ground together. The horse reared and fell, \n",
      "but Luthien was flung aside, and lay upon the grass. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Beren throttled Curufin; but death was near him, \n",
      "for Celegorm rode upon him with a spear, in that hour Huan \n",
      "forsook the service or Celegorm, and sprang upon him, so \n",
      "that his horse swerved aside, and would not approach \n",
      "Beren because of the terror of the great hound. Celegorm \n",
      "cursed both hound and horse, but Huan was unmoved. \n",
      "Then Luthien rising forbade the slaying of Curufin; but \n",
      "Beren despoiled him of his gear and weapons, and took \n",
      "his knife, sheathless by his side; iron it would cleave as if it \n",
      "were green wood. Then Beren lifting Curufin flung him from \n",
      "him, and bade him walk now back to his noble kinsfolk, who \n",
      "might teach him to turn his valour to worthier use. 'Your \n",
      "horse,' he said, 'I keep for the service of Luthien, and it may \n",
      "be accounted happy to be free of such a master.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Curufin cursed Beren under cloud and sky. 'Go \n",
      "hence,' he said, 'unto a swift and bitter death.' Celegorm \n",
      "took him beside him on his horse, and the brothers made \n",
      "then as if to ride away; and Beren turned away and took no \n",
      "heed of their words. But Curufin, being filled with shame \n",
      "and malice, took the bow of Celegorm and shot back as \n",
      "they went; and the arrow was aimed at Luthien. Huan \n",
      "leaping caught it in his mouth; but Curufin shot again, and \n",
      "Beren sprang before Luthien, and the dart smote him in the \n",
      "breast. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is told that Huan pursued the sons of Feanor, and \n",
      "they fled in fear; and returning he brought to Luthien a herb \n",
      "out of the forest. With that leaf he staunched Beren's \n",
      "wound, and by her arts and by her love she healed him; and \n",
      "thus at last they returned to Doriath. There Beren, being \n",
      "torn between his oath and his love, and knowing Luthien to \n",
      "be now safe, arose one morning before the sun, and \n",
      "committed her to the care of Huan; then in great anguish he \n",
      "departed while she yet slept upon the grass. \n",
      "\n",
      "He rode northward again with all speed to the Pass of \n",
      "Sirion, and coming to the skirts of Taur-nu-Fuin he looked \n",
      "out across the waste of Anfauglith and saw afar the peaks \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "of Thangorodrim. There he dismissed the horse of Curufin, \n",
      "and bade it leave now dread and servitude and run free \n",
      "upon the green grass in the lands of Sirion. Then being now \n",
      "alone and upon the threshold of the final peril he made the \n",
      "Song of Parting, in praise of Luthien and the lights of \n",
      "heaven; for he believed that he must now say farewell to \n",
      "both love and light. Of that song these words were part: \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Farewell sweet earth and northern sky, \n",
      "forever blest, since here did lie \n",
      "and here with lissom limbs did run \n",
      "beneath the Moon, beneath the Sun, \n",
      "Luthien Tinuviel \n",
      "\n",
      "more fair than mortal tongue can tell. \n",
      "\n",
      "Though all to ruin fell the world \n",
      "\n",
      "and were dissolved and backward hurled \n",
      "\n",
      "unmade into the old abyss, \n",
      "\n",
      "yet were its making good, forthis- \n",
      "\n",
      "the dusk, the dawn, the earth, the sea- \n",
      "\n",
      "that Luthien for a time should be. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And he sang aloud, caring not what ear should \n",
      "overhear him, for he was desperate and looked for no \n",
      "escape. \n",
      "\n",
      "But Luthien heard his song, and she sang in answer, \n",
      "as she came through the woods unlooked for. For Huan, \n",
      "consenting once more to be her steed, had borne her \n",
      "swiftly hard upon Beren's trail. Long he had pondered in his \n",
      "heart what counsel he could devise for the lightning of the \n",
      "peril of these two whom he loved. He turned aside therefore \n",
      "at Sauron's isle, as they ran northward again, and he took \n",
      "thence the ghastly wolf-hame of Draugluin, and the bat-fell \n",
      "of Thuringwethil. She was the messenger of Sauron, and \n",
      "was wont to fly in vampire's form to Angband; and her great \n",
      "fingered wings were barbed at each joint's end with and \n",
      "iron claw. Clad in these dreadful garments Huan and \n",
      "Luthien ran through Taur-nu-Fuin, and all things fled before \n",
      "them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Beren seeing their approach was dismayed; and he \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "wondered, for he had heard the voice of Tinuviel, and he \n",
      "thought it now a phantom for his ensnaring. But they halted \n",
      "and cast aside their disguise, and Luthien ran towards him. \n",
      "Thus Beren and Luthien met again between the desert and \n",
      "the wood. For a while he was silent and was glad; but after \n",
      "a space he strove once more to dissuade Luthien from her \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thrice now I curse my oath to Thingol,' he said, 'and I \n",
      "would that he had slain me in Menegroth, rather than I \n",
      "should bring you under the shadow of Morgoth.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then for the second time Huan spoke with words; and \n",
      "he counselled Beren, saying: 'From the shadow of death \n",
      "you can no longer save Luthien, for by her love she is now \n",
      "subject to it. You can turn from your fate and lead her into \n",
      "exile, seeking peace in vain while your life lasts. But if you \n",
      "will not deny your doom, then either Luthien, being \n",
      "forsaken, must assuredly die alone, or she must with you \n",
      "challenge the fate that lies before you--hopeless, yet not \n",
      "certain. Further counsel I cannot give, nor may I go further \n",
      "on your road. But my heart forebodes that what you find at \n",
      "the Gate I shall myself see. All else is dark to me; yet it may \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "be that our three paths lead back to Doriath, and we may \n",
      "meet before the end.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Beren perceived that Luthien could not be \n",
      "divided from the doom that lay upon them both, and he \n",
      "sought no longer to dissuade her. By the counsel of Huan \n",
      "and the arts of Luthien he was arrayed now in the hame of \n",
      "Draugluin, and she in the winged fell of Thuringwethil. Beren \n",
      "became in all things like a werewolf to look upon, save that \n",
      "in his eyes there shone a spirit grim indeed but clean; and \n",
      "horror was in his glance as he saw upon his flank a bat-like \n",
      "creature clinging with creased wings. Then howling under \n",
      "the moon he leaped down the hill, and the bat wheeled and \n",
      "flittered above him. \n",
      "\n",
      "They passed through all perils, until they came with the \n",
      "dust of their long and weary road upon them to the drear \n",
      "dale that lay before the Gate of Angband. Black chasms \n",
      "opened beside the road, whence forms as of writhing \n",
      "serpents issued. On either hand the cliffs stood as \n",
      "embattled walls, and upon them sat carrion fowl crying with \n",
      "fell voices. Before them was the impregnable Gate, an arch \n",
      "wide and dark at the foot of the mountain; above it reared a \n",
      "thousand feet of precipice. \n",
      "\n",
      "There dismay took them, for at the gate was a guard of \n",
      "whom no tidings had yet gone forth. Rumour of he knew not \n",
      "what designs abroad among the princes of the Elves had \n",
      "come to Morgoth, and ever down the aisles of the forest \n",
      "was heard the baying of Huan, the great hound of war, \n",
      "whom long ago the Valar unleashed. Then Morgoth recalled \n",
      "the doom of Huan, and he chose one from among the \n",
      "whelps of the race of Draugluin; and he fed him with his \n",
      "own hand upon living flesh, and put his power upon him. \n",
      "Swiftly the wolf grew, until he could creep into no den, but \n",
      "lay huge and hungry before the feet of Morgoth. There the \n",
      "fire and anguish of hell entered into him, and he became \n",
      "filled with a devouring spirit, tormented, terrible, and strong. \n",
      "Carcharoth, the Red Maw, he is named in the tales of those \n",
      "days, and Anfauglir, the Jaws of Thirst. And Morgoth set \n",
      "him to lie unsleeping before the doors of Angband, lest \n",
      "Huan come. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now Carcharoth espied them from afar, and he was \n",
      "filled with doubt; for news had long been brought to \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Angband that Draugluin was dead. Therefore when they \n",
      "approached he denied them entry, and bade them stand; \n",
      "and he drew near with menace, scenting something \n",
      "strange in the air about them. But suddenly some power, \n",
      "descended from of old from divine race, possessed \n",
      "Luthien, and casting back her foul raiment she stood forth, \n",
      "small before the might of Carcharoth, but radiant and \n",
      "terrible. Lifting up her hand she commanded him to sleep, \n",
      "saying: 'O woe-begotten spirit, fall now into dark oblivion, \n",
      "and forget for a while the dreadful doom of life.' And \n",
      "Carcharoth was felled, as though lightning had smitten him. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Beren and Luthien went through the Gate, and \n",
      "down the labyrinthine stairs; and together wrought the \n",
      "greatest deed that has been dared by Elves or Men. For \n",
      "they came to the seat of Morgoth in his nethermost hall that \n",
      "was upheld by horror, lit by fire, and filled with weapons of \n",
      "death and torment. There Beren slunk in wolfs form \n",
      "beneath his throne; but Luthien was stripped of her \n",
      "disguise by the will of Morgoth, and he bent his gaze upon \n",
      "her. She was not daunted by his eyes; and she named her \n",
      "own name, and offered her service to sing before him, after \n",
      "the manner of a minstrel. Then Morgoth looking upon her \n",
      "beauty conceived in his thought an evil lust, and a design \n",
      "more dark than any that had yet come into his heart since \n",
      "he fled from Valinor. Thus he was beguiled by his own \n",
      "malice, for he watched her, leaving her free for awhile, and \n",
      "taking secret pleasure in his thought. Then suddenly she \n",
      "eluded his sight, and out of the shadows began a song of \n",
      "such surpassing loveliness, and of such blinding power, \n",
      "that he listened perforce; and a blindness came upon him, \n",
      "as his eyes roamed to and fro, seeking her. \n",
      "\n",
      "All his court were cast down in slumber, and all the \n",
      "fires faded and were quenched; but the Silmarils in the \n",
      "crown on Morgoth's head blazed forth suddenly with a \n",
      "radiance of white flame; and the burden of that crown and \n",
      "of the jewels bowed down his head, as though the world \n",
      "were set upon it, laden with a weight of care, of fear, and of \n",
      "desire, that even the will of Morgoth could not support. Then \n",
      "Luthien catching up her winged robe sprang into the air, \n",
      "and her voice came dropping down like rain into pools, \n",
      "profound and dark. She cast her cloak before his eyes, and \n",
      "set upon him a dream, dark as the outer Void where once \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "he walked alone. \n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly he fell, as a hill sliding in avalanche, and \n",
      "hurled like thunder from his throne lay prone upon the floors \n",
      "of hell. The iron crown rolled echoing from his head. All \n",
      "things were still. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a dead beast Beren lay upon the ground; but \n",
      "Luthien touching him with her hand aroused him, and he \n",
      "cast aside the wolf-hame. Then he drew forth the knife \n",
      "Angrist; and from the iron claws that held it he cut a Silmaril. \n",
      "\n",
      "As he closed it in his hand, the radiance welled \n",
      "through his living flesh, and his hand became as a shining \n",
      "lamp; but the jewel suffered his touch and hurt him not. It \n",
      "came then into Beren's mind that he would go beyond his \n",
      "vow, and bear out of Angband all three of the Jewels of \n",
      "Feanor; but such was not the doom of the Silmarils. The \n",
      "knife Angrist snapped, and a shard of the blade flying \n",
      "smote the cheek of Morgoth. He groaned and stirred, and \n",
      "all the host of Angband moved in sleep. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then terror fell upon Beren and Luthien, and they fled, \n",
      "heedless and without disguise, desiring only to see the light \n",
      "once more. They were neither hindered nor pursued, but \n",
      "the Gate was held against their going out; for Carcharoth \n",
      "had arisen from sleep, and stood now in wrath upon the \n",
      "threshold of Angband. Before they were aware of him, he \n",
      "saw them, and sprang upon them as they ran. \n",
      "\n",
      "Luthien was spent, and she had not time nor strength \n",
      "to quell the wolf. But Beren strode forth before her, and in \n",
      "his right hand he held aloft the Silmaril. Carcharoth halted, \n",
      "and for a moment was afraid. 'Get you gone, and fly!' cried \n",
      "Beren; 'for here is afire that shall consume you, and all evil \n",
      "things.' And he thrust the Silmaril before the eyes of the \n",
      "wolf. \n",
      "\n",
      "But Carcharoth looked upon that holy jewel and was \n",
      "not daunted, and the devouring spirit within him awoke to \n",
      "sudden fire; and gaping he took suddenly the hand within \n",
      "his jaws, and he bit it off at the wrist. Then swiftly all his \n",
      "inwards were filled with a flame of anguish, and the Silmaril \n",
      "seared his accursed flesh. Howling he led before them, and \n",
      "the walls of the valley of the Gate echoes with the clamour \n",
      "of his torment. So terrible did he become in his madness \n",
      "that all the creatures of Morgoth that abode in that valley, or \n",
      "were upon any of the roads that led thither, fled far away 1 for \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "he slew all living things that stood in his path, and burst from \n",
      "the North with ruin upon the world. Of all the terrors that \n",
      "came ever into Beleriand ere Angband's fall the madness \n",
      "of Carcharoth was the most dreadful; for the power of the \n",
      "Silmaril was hidden within him. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now Beren lay in a swoon within the perilous Gate, \n",
      "and death drew nigh him for there was venom on the fangs \n",
      "of the wolf. Luthien with her lips drew out the venom, and \n",
      "she put forth her failing power to staunch the hideous \n",
      "wound. But behind her in the depths of Angband the rumour \n",
      "grew of great wrath aroused. The host of Morgoth were \n",
      "awakened. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus the quest of the Silmaril was like to have ended in \n",
      "ruin and despair; but in that hour above the wall of the valley \n",
      "three mighty birds appeared, flying northward with wings \n",
      "swifter than the wind. Among all birds and beasts the \n",
      "wandering and need of Beren had been noised, and Huan \n",
      "himself had bidden all things watch, that they might bring \n",
      "him aid. High above the realm of Morgoth Thorondor and \n",
      "his vassals soared, and seeing now the madness of the \n",
      "Wolf and Beren's fall they came swiftly down, even as the \n",
      "powers of Angband were released from the toils of sleep. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they lifted up Luthien and Beren from the earth, \n",
      "and bore them aloft into the clouds. Below them suddenly \n",
      "thunder rolled, lightnings leaped upward, and the mountains \n",
      "quaked. Fire and smoke belched forth from Thangorodrim, \n",
      "and flaming bolts were hurled far abroad, falling ruinous \n",
      "upon the lands; and the Noldor in Hithlum trembled. But \n",
      "Thorondor took his way far above the earth, seeking the \n",
      "high roads of heaven, where the sun daylong shines \n",
      "unveiled and the moon walks amid the cloudless stars. \n",
      "Thus they passed swiftly over Dor-nu-Fauglith, and over \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Taur-nu-Fuin, and came above the hidden valley of \n",
      "Tumladen. No cloud nor mist lay there, and looking down \n",
      "Luthien saw far below, as a white light starting from a green \n",
      "jewel, the radiance of Gondolin the fair where Turgon dwelt. \n",
      "But she wept, for she thought that Beren would surely die, \n",
      "he spoke no word, nor opened his eyes, and knew \n",
      "thereafter nothing of his flight. And at the last the eagles set \n",
      "them down upon the borders of Doriath; and they were \n",
      "come to that same dell whence Beren had stolen in despair \n",
      "and left Luthien asleep. \n",
      "\n",
      "There the eagles laid her at Beren's side and returned \n",
      "to the peaks of Crissaegrim and their high eyries; but Huan \n",
      "came to her, and together they tended Beren, even as \n",
      "before when she healed him of the wound that Curufin gave \n",
      "to him. But this wound was fell and poisonous. Long Beren \n",
      "lay, and his spirit wandered upon the dark borders of death, \n",
      "knowing every an anguish that pursued him from dream to \n",
      "dream. Then suddenly, when her hope was almost spent, \n",
      "he woke again, and looked up, seeing leaves against the \n",
      "sky; and he heard beneath the leaves singing soft and slow \n",
      "beside him Luthien Tinuviel. And it was spring again. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thereafter Beren was named Erchamion, which is the \n",
      "One-handed; and suffering was graven in his face. But at \n",
      "last he was drawn back to life by the love of Luthien, and he \n",
      "arose, and together they walked in the woods once more. \n",
      "And they did not hasten from that place, for it seemed fair \n",
      "to them. Luthien indeed was willing to wander in the wild \n",
      "without returning, forgetting house and people and all the \n",
      "glory of the Elf-kingdoms, and for a time Beren was \n",
      "content; but he could not for long forget his oath to return to \n",
      "Menegroth, nor would he withhold Luthien from Thingol for \n",
      "ever. For he held by the law of Men, deeming it perilous to \n",
      "set at naught the will of the father, save at the last need; and \n",
      "is seemed also to him unfit that one so royal and fair as \n",
      "Luthien should live always in the woods, as the rude hunters \n",
      "among Men, without home or honour or the fair things which \n",
      "are the delight of the queens of the Eldalie. Therefore after \n",
      "a while he persuaded her, and their footsteps forsook the \n",
      "houseless lands; and he passed into Doriath, leading \n",
      "Luthien home. So their doom willed it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Upon Doriath evil days had fallen. Grief and silence \n",
      "had come upon all its people when Luthien was lost. Long \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "they had sought for her in vain. And it is told that in that time \n",
      "Daeron the minstrel of Thingol strayed from the land, and \n",
      "was seen no more. He it was that made music for the \n",
      "dance and song of Luthien, before Beren came to Doriath; \n",
      "and he had loved her, and set all his thought of her in his \n",
      "music. He became the greatest of all the minstrels of the \n",
      "Elves east of the Sea, named even before Maglor son of \n",
      "Feanor. But seeking for Luthien in despair he wandered \n",
      "upon strange paths, and passing over the mountains he \n",
      "came into the East of Middle-earth, where for many ages \n",
      "he made lament beside dark waters for Luthien, daughter \n",
      "of Thingol, most beautiful of all living things. \n",
      "\n",
      "In that time Thingol turned to Melian; but now she \n",
      "withheld her counsel from him, saying that the doom that he \n",
      "had devised must work to its appointed end, and that he \n",
      "must wait now upon time. But Thingol learned that Luthien \n",
      "had journeyed far from Doriath, for messages came \n",
      "secretly from Celegorm, as has been told, saying that \n",
      "Felagund was dead, and Beren was dead, but Luthien was \n",
      "in Nargothrond, and that Celegorm would wed her. Then \n",
      "Thingol was wrathful, and he sent forth spies, thinking to \n",
      "make war upon Nargothrond; and thus he learned that \n",
      "Luthien was again fled, and that Celegorm and Curufin \n",
      "were driven from Nargothrond. Then his counsel was in \n",
      "doubt, for he had not the strength to assail the seven sons \n",
      "of Feanor; but he sent messengers to Himring to summon \n",
      "their aid in seeking for Luthien, since Celegorm had not \n",
      "sent her to the house of her father, nor had he kept her \n",
      "safely. \n",
      "\n",
      "But in the north of his realm his messengers met with a \n",
      "peril sudden and unlooked for: the onslaught of Carcharoth, \n",
      "the Wolf of Angband. In his madness he had run ravening \n",
      "from the north, and passing at length over Taurlnu-Fuin \n",
      "upon its eastern side he came down from the sources of \n",
      "Esgalduin like a destroying fire. Nothing hindered him, and \n",
      "the might of Melian upon the borders of the land stayed him \n",
      "not; for fate drove him, and the power of the Silmaril that he \n",
      "bore to his torment. Thus he burst into the inviolate woods \n",
      "of Doriath, and all fled away in fear. Alone of the \n",
      "messengers Mablung, chief captain of the King, escaped, \n",
      "and he brought the dread tidings to Thingol. \n",
      "\n",
      "Even in that dark hour Beren and Luthien returned, \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hastening from the west, and the news of their coming went \n",
      "before them like a sound of music borne by the wind into \n",
      "dark houses where men sit sorrowful. They came at last to \n",
      "the gates of Menegroth, and a great host followed them. \n",
      "Then Beren led Luthien before the throne of Thingol her \n",
      "father; and he looked in wonder upon Beren, whom he had \n",
      "thought dead; but he loved him not, because of the woes \n",
      "that he had brought upon Doriath. But Beren knelt before \n",
      "him, and said: 'I return according to my word. I am come \n",
      "now to claim my own.' \n",
      "\n",
      "And Thingol answered: 'What of your quest, and of \n",
      "your vow?' \n",
      "\n",
      "But Beren said: 'It is fulfilled. Even now a Silmaril is in \n",
      "my hand.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Thingol said: 'Show it to me!' \n",
      "\n",
      "And Beren put forth his left hand, slowly opening its \n",
      "fingers; but it was empty. Then he held up his right arm; and \n",
      "from that hour he named himself Camlost, the Empty- \n",
      "handed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Thingol's mood was softened; and Beren sat \n",
      "before his throne upon the left, and Luthien upon the right, \n",
      "and they told all the tale of the Quest, while all there listened \n",
      "and were filled with amazement. And it seemed to Thingol \n",
      "that this Man was unlike all other mortal Men, and among \n",
      "the great in Arda, and the love of Luthien a thing new and \n",
      "strange; and he perceived that their doom might not be \n",
      "withstood by any power of the world. Therefore at the last \n",
      "he yielded his will, and Beren took the hand of Luthien \n",
      "before the throne of her father. \n",
      "\n",
      "But now a shadow fell upon the joy of Doriath at the \n",
      "return of Luthien the fair; for learning of the cause of the \n",
      "madness of Carcharoth the people grew the more afraid, \n",
      "perceiving that his danger was fraught with dreadful power \n",
      "because of the holy jewel, and hardly might be overthrown. \n",
      "And Beren, hearing of the onslaught of the Wolf, \n",
      "understood that the Quest was not yet fulfilled. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, since daily Carcharoth drew nearer to \n",
      "Menegroth, they prepared the Hunting of the Wolf; of all \n",
      "pursuits of beasts whereof tales tell the most perilous. To \n",
      "that chase went Huan the Hound of Valinor, and Mablung of \n",
      "the Heavy Hand, and Beleg Strongbow, and Beren \n",
      "Erchamion, and Thingol King of Doriath. They rode forth in \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the morning and passed over the River Esgalduin; but \n",
      "Luthien remained behind at the gates of Menegroth. A dark \n",
      "shadow fell upon her and it seemed to her that the sun had \n",
      "sickened and turned black. \n",
      "\n",
      "The hunters turned east and north, and following the \n",
      "course of the river they came at last upon Carcharoth the \n",
      "Wolf in a dark valley, down the northern side whereof \n",
      "Esgalduin fell in a torrent over steep falls. At the foot of the \n",
      "falls Carcharoth drank to ease his consuming thirst, and he \n",
      "howled, and thus they were aware of him, But he, espying \n",
      "their approach, rushed not suddenly to attack them. It may \n",
      "be that the devil's cunning of his heart awoke, being for a \n",
      "moment eased of his pain by the sweet waters of \n",
      "Esgalduin; and even as they rode towards him he slunk \n",
      "aside into a deep brake, and there lay hid. But they set a \n",
      "guard about all that place, and waited, and the shadows \n",
      "grew lonq in the forest. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Beren stood beside Thingol, and suddenly they were \n",
      "aware that Huan had left their side. Then a great baying \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "awoke in the thicket; for Huan becoming impatient and \n",
      "desiring to look upon this wolf had gone in alone to \n",
      "dislodge him. But Carcharoth avoided him, and bursting \n",
      "form the thorns leaped suddenly upon Thingol. Swiftly \n",
      "Beren strode before him with a spear, but Carcharoth \n",
      "swept it aside and felled him, biting at his breast. In that \n",
      "moment Huan leaped from the thicket upon the back of the \n",
      "Wolf, and they fell together fighting bitterly; and no battle of \n",
      "wolf and hound has been like to it, for in the baying of Huan \n",
      "was heard the voice of the horns of Orome and the wrath of \n",
      "the Valar, but in the howls of Carcharoth was the hate of \n",
      "Morgoth and malice crueller than teeth of steel; and the \n",
      "rocks were rent by their clamour and fell from on high and \n",
      "choked the falls of Esgalduin. There they fought to the \n",
      "death; but Thingol gave no heed, for he knelt by Beren, \n",
      "seeing that he was sorely hurt. \n",
      "\n",
      "Huan in that hour slew Carcharoth; but there in the \n",
      "woven woods of Doriath his own doom long spoken was \n",
      "fulfilled, and he was wounded mortally, and the venom of \n",
      "Morgoth entered into him. Then he came, and falling beside \n",
      "Beren spoke for the third time with words; and he bade \n",
      "Beren farewell before he died. Beren spoke not, but laid his \n",
      "hand upon the head of the hound, and so they parted. \n",
      "\n",
      "Mablung and Beleg came hastening to the King's aid, \n",
      "but when they looked upon what was done they cast aside \n",
      "their spears and wept. Then Mablung took a knife and \n",
      "ripped up the belly of the Wolf; and within he was well nigh \n",
      "all consumed as with a fire, but the hand of Beren that held \n",
      "the jewel was yet incorrupt. But when Mablung reached \n",
      "forth to touch it, the hand was no more, and the Silmaril lay \n",
      "there unveiled, and the light of it filled the shadows of the \n",
      "forest all about hem. Then quickly and in fear Mablung took \n",
      "it and set it in Beren's living hand; and Beren was aroused \n",
      "by the touch of the Silmaril, and held it aloft, and bade \n",
      "Thingol receive it. 'Now is the Quest achieved,' he said, \n",
      "'and my doom full-wrought'; and he spoke no more. \n",
      "\n",
      "They bore back Beren Camlost son of Barahir upon a \n",
      "bier of branches with Huan the wolfhound at his side; and \n",
      "night fell ere they returned to Menegroth. At the feet of \n",
      "Hirilorn the great beech Luthien met them walking slow, and \n",
      "some bore torches beside the bier. There she set her arms \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "about Beren, and kissed him bidding him await her beyond \n",
      "the Western Sea; and he looked upon her eyes ere the \n",
      "spirit left him. But the starlight was quenched and darkness \n",
      "had fallen even upon Luthien Tmuviel. Thus ended the \n",
      "Quest of the Silmaril; but the Lay of Leithian, Release form \n",
      "Bondage does not end. \n",
      "\n",
      "For the spirit of Beren at her bidding tarried in the halls \n",
      "of Mandos, unwilling to leave the world, until Luthien came \n",
      "to say her last farewell upon the dim shores of the Outer \n",
      "Sea, whence Men that die set out never to return. But the \n",
      "spirit of Luthien fell down into darkness, and at the last it \n",
      "fled, and her body lay like a flower that is suddenly cut off \n",
      "and lies for a while unwithered on the grass. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then a winter, as it were the hoar age of mortal Men, \n",
      "fell upon Thingol. But Luthien came to the halls of Mandos, \n",
      "where are the appointed places of the Eldalie, beyond the \n",
      "mansions of the West upon the confines of the world. There \n",
      "those that wait sit in the shadow of their thought. But her \n",
      "beauty was more than their beauty, and her sorrow deeper \n",
      "than their sorrows; and she knelt before Mandos and sang \n",
      "to him. \n",
      "\n",
      "The song of Luthien before Mandos was the song \n",
      "most fair that ever in words was woven, and the song most \n",
      "sorrowful that ever the world shall ever hear. Unchanged, \n",
      "imperishable, it is sung still in Valinor beyond the hearing of \n",
      "the world, and the listening the Valar grieved. For Luthien \n",
      "wove two themes of words, of the sorrow of the Eldar and \n",
      "the grief of Men, of the Two Kindreds that were made by \n",
      "lluvatar to dwell in Arda, the Kingdom of Earth amid the \n",
      "innumerable stars. And as she knelt before him her tears \n",
      "fell upon his feet like rain upon stones; and Mandos was \n",
      "moved to pity, who never before was so moved, nor has \n",
      "been since. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore he summoned Beren, and even as Luthien \n",
      "had spoken in the hour of his death they met again beyond \n",
      "the Western Sea. But Mandos had no power to withhold the \n",
      "spirits of Men that were dead within the confines of the \n",
      "world, after their time of waiting; nor could he change the \n",
      "fates of the Children of lluvatar. He went therefore to \n",
      "Manwe, Lord of the Valar, who governed the world under \n",
      "the hand of lluvatar; and Manwe sought counsel in his \n",
      "inmost thought, where the will of lluvatar was revealed. \n",
      "\n",

      "every day that he looked upon the Silmaril the more he \n",

      "march with banners displayed in open force over \n",

      "forth from the passes of Hithlum; and thus they thought to \n",
      "take the might of Morgoth as between anvil and hammer, \n",

      "On the appointed day, on the morning of Midsummer, \n",

      "there all the Noldor of Hithlum were assembled, together \n",
      "with Elves of the Falas and Gwindor's company from \n",
      "Nargothrond, and he had great strength of Men: upon the \n",
      "right were the host of Dor-lomin and all the valour of Hurin \n",

      "\n",
      "Then Fingon looked towards Thangorodrim, and there \n",
      "was a dark cloud about it, and a black smoke went up; and \n",
      "he knew that the wrath of Morgoth was aroused, and that \n",
      "their challenge was accepted. A shadow of doubt fell upon \n",
      "Fingon's heart; and he looked eastwards, seeking if he \n",
      "might see with elven-sight the dust of Anfauglith rising \n",
      "beneath the hosts of Maedhros. He knew not that \n",
      "Maedhros was hindered in his setting-forth by the guile of \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Uldor the accursed, who deceived him with false warnings \n",

      "south from vale to vale, and Elves and Men lifted their \n",
      "voices in wonder and joy. For unsummoned and unlocked \n",
      "for Turgon had opened the leaguer of Gondolin, and was \n",
      "come with an army ten thousand strong, with bright mail \n",
      "and long swords and spears like a forest. Then when \n",
      "Fingon heard afar the great trumpet of Turgon his brother, \n",
      "the shadow passed and his heart was uplifted, and he \n",
      "shouted aloud: 'Utulie'n aure! Aiya Eldalie ar Atanatari, \n",
      "utulie'n aure! The day has come! Behold, people of the \n",
      "Eldar and Fathers of Men, the day has come!' And all those \n",
      "who heard his great voice echo in the hills answered crying: \n",
      "'Auta i tome ! The night is passing!' \n",
      "\n",
      "Now Morgoth, who knew much of what was done and \n",
      "designed by his enemies, chose his hour, and trusting in \n",
      "his treacherous servants to hold back Maedhros and \n",
      "prevent the union of his foes he sent a force seeming great \n",
      "(and yet but part of all that he had made ready) towards \n",
      "Hithlum; and they were clad all in dun raiment and showed \n",
      "no naked steel, and thus were already far over the sands of \n",
      "Anfauglith before their approach was seen. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the hearts of the Noldor grew hot, and their \n",
      "captains wished to assail their foes upon the plain; but \n",
      "Hurin spoke against it, and bade them beware of the guile \n",
      "of Morgoth, whose strength was always greater than it \n",
      "seemed, and his purpose other than he revealed. And \n",
      "though the signal of the approach of Maedhros came not, \n",
      "and the host grew impatient, Hurin urged them still to await \n",
      "it, and to let the Ores break themselves in assault upon the \n",
      "hills. \n",
      "\n",
      "But the Captain of Morgoth in the west had been \n",
      "commanded to draw out Fingon swiftly from his hills by \n",
      "whatever means he could. He marched on therefore until \n",
      "the front of his battle was drawn up before the stream of \n",
      "Sirion, from the walls of the fortress of Eithel Sirion to the \n",
      "inflowing of Rivil at the Fen of Serech; and the outposts of \n",
      "Fingon could see the eyes of their enemies. But there was \n",
      "no answer to his challenge, and the taunts of the Ores \n",
      "faltered as they looked upon the silent walls and the hidden \n",
      "threat of the hills. Then the Captain of Morgoth sent out \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "riders with tokens of parley, and they rode up before the \n",
      "outworks of the Barad Eithel. With them they brought \n",
      "Gelmir son of Guilin, that lord of Nargothrond whom they \n",
      "had captured in the Bragollach; and they had blinded him. \n",
      "Then the heralds of Angband showed him forth, crying: 'We \n",
      "have many more such at home, but you must make haste if \n",
      "you would find them; for we shall deal with them all when we \n",
      "return even so.' And they hewed off Gelmiris hands and \n",
      "feet, and his head last, within sight of the Elves, and left \n",
      "him. \n",
      "\n",
      "By ill chance, at that place in the outworks stood \n",
      "Gwindor of Nargothrond, the brother of Gelmir. Now his \n",
      "wrath was kindled to madness, and he leapt forth on \n",
      "horseback, and many riders with him; and they pursued the \n",
      "heralds and slew them, and drove on deep into the main \n",
      "host. And seeing this all the host of the Noldor was set on \n",
      "fire, and Fingon put on his white helm and sounded his \n",
      "trumpets, and all the host of Hithlum leapt forth from the hills \n",
      "in sudden onslaught. The light of the drawing of the swords \n",
      "of the Noldor was like a fire in a field of reeds; and so fell \n",
      "and swift was their onset that almost the designs of \n",
      "Morgoth went astray. Before the army that he sent \n",
      "westward could be strengthened it was swept away, and \n",
      "the banners of Fingon passed over Anfauglith and were \n",
      "raised before the walls of Angband. Ever in the forefront of \n",
      "that battle went Gwindor and the Elves of Nargothrond, and \n",
      "even now they could not be restrained; and they burst \n",
      "through the Gate and slew the guards upon the very stairs \n",
      "of Angband, and Morgoth trembled upon his deep throne, \n",
      "hearing them beat upon his doors. But they were trapped \n",
      "there, and all were slain save Gwindor only, whom they took \n",
      "alive; for Fingon could not come to their aid. By many \n",
      "secret doors in Thangorodrim Morgoth had let issue forth \n",
      "his main host that he held in waiting, and Fingon was \n",
      "beaten back with great loss from the walls. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then in the plain of Anfauglith, on the fourth day of the \n",
      "war, there began Nirnaeth Arnoediad, Unnumbered Tears, \n",
      "for no song or tale can contain all its grief. The host of \n",
      "Fingon retreated over the sands, and Haldir lord of the \n",
      "Haladin was slain in the rearguard; with him fell most of the \n",
      "Men of Brethil, and came never back to their woods. But on \n",
      "the fifth day as night fell, and they were still far from Ered \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Wethrin, the Ores surrounded the host of Hithlum, and they \n",
      "fought until day, pressed ever closer. In the morning came \n",
      "hope, when the horns of Turgon were heard as he marched \n",
      "up with the main host of Gondolin; for they had been \n",
      "stationed southward guarding the Pass of Sirion, and \n",
      "Turgon restrained most of his people from the rash \n",
      "onslaught. Now he hastened to the aid of his brother; and \n",
      "the Gondolindrim were strong and clad in mail, and their \n",
      "ranks shone like a river of steel in the sun. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now the phalanx of the guard of the King broke through \n",
      "the ranks of the Ores, and Turgon hewed his way to the \n",
      "side of his brother; and it is told that the meeting of Turgon \n",
      "with Hurin, who stood beside Fingon, was glad in the midst \n",
      "of battle. Then hope was renewed in the hearts of the Elves; \n",
      "and in that very time, at the third hour of morning, the \n",
      "trumpets of Maedhros were heard at last coming up from \n",
      "the east, and the banners of the sons of Feanor assailed \n",
      "the enemy in the rear. Some have said that even then the \n",
      "Eldar might have won the day, had all their hosts proved \n",
      "faithful; for the Ores wavered, and their onslaught was \n",
      "stayed, and already some were turning to flight. But even as \n",
      "the vanguard of Maedhros came upon the Ores, Morgoth \n",
      "loosed his last strength, and Angband was emptied. There \n",
      "came wolves, and wolfriders, and there came Balrogs, and \n",
      "dragons, and Glaurung father of dragons. The strength and \n",
      "terror of the Great Worm were now great indeed, and Elves \n",
      "and Men withered before him; and he came between the \n",
      "hosts of Maedhros and Fingon and swept them apart. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yet neither by wolf, nor by Balrog, nor by Dragon, \n",
      "would Morgoth have achieved his end, but for the treachery \n",
      "of Men. In this hour the plots of Ulfang were revealed. Many \n",
      "of the Easterlings turned and fled, their hearts being filled \n",
      "with lies and fear; but the sons of Ulfang went over suddenly \n",
      "to Morgoth and drove in upon the rear of the sons of \n",
      "Feanor, and in the confusion that they wrought they came \n",
      "near to the standard of Maedhros. They reaped not the \n",
      "reward that Morgoth promised them, for Maglor slew Uldor \n",
      "the accursed, the leader in treason, and the sons of Bor \n",
      "slew Ulfast and Ulwarth ere they themselves were slain. But \n",
      "new strength of evil Men came up that Uldor had \n",
      "summoned and kept hidden in the eastern hills, and the \n",
      "host of Maedhros was assailed now on three sides, and it \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "broke, and was scattered, and fled this way and that. Yet \n",
      "fate saved the sons of Feanor, and though all were \n",
      "wounded none were slain, for they drew together, and \n",
      "gathering a remnant of the Noldor and the Naugrim about \n",
      "them they hewed a way out of the battle and escaped far \n",
      "away towards Mount Dolmed in the east. \n",
      "\n",
      "Last of all the eastern force to stand firm were the \n",
      "Dwarves of Belegost, and thus they won renown. For the \n",
      "Naugrim withstood fire more hardily than either Elves or \n",
      "Men, and it was their custom moreover to wear great \n",
      "masks in battle hideous to look upon; and those stood them \n",
      "in good stead against the dragons. And but for them \n",
      "Glaurung and his brood would have withered all that was \n",
      "left of the Noldor. But the Naugrim made a circle about him \n",
      "when he assailed them, and even his mighty armour was \n",
      "not full proof against the blows of their great axes; and \n",
      "when in his rage Glaurung turned and struck down Azaghal, \n",
      "Lord of Belegost, and crawled over him, with his last stroke \n",
      "Azaghal drove a knife into his belly, and so wounded him \n",
      "that he fled the field, and the beasts of Angband in dismay \n",
      "followed after him. Then the Dwarves raised up the body of \n",
      "Azaghal and bore it away; and with slow steps they walked \n",
      "behind singing a dirge in deep voices, as it were a funeral \n",
      "pomp in their country, and gave no heed more to their foes; \n",
      "and none dared to stay them. \n",
      "\n",
      "But now in the western battle Fingon and Turgon were \n",
      "assailed by a tide of foes thrice greater than all the force \n",
      "that was left to them. Gothmog, Lord of Balrogs, high- \n",
      "captain of Angband, was come; and he drove a dark \n",
      "wedge between the Elvenhosts, surrounding King Fingon, \n",
      "and thrusting Turgon and Hurin aside towards the Fen of \n",
      "Serech. Then he turned upon Fingon. That was a grim \n",
      "meeting. At last Fingon stood alone with his guard dead \n",
      "about him; and he fought with Gothmog, until another \n",
      "Balrog came behind and cast a thong of fire about him. \n",
      "Then Gothmog hewed him with his black axe, and a white \n",
      "flame sprang up from the helm of Fingon as it was cloven. \n",
      "Thus fell the High King of the Noldor; and they beat him into \n",
      "the dust with their maces, and his banner, blue and silver, \n",
      "they trod into the mire of his blood. \n",
      "\n",
      "The field was lost; but still Hurin and Huor and the \n",
      "remnant of the house of Hador stood firm with Turgon of \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Gondolin, and the hosts of Morgoth could not yet win the \n",
      "Pass of Sirion. Then Hurin spoke to Turgon, saying: 'Go \n",
      "now, lord, while time is! For in you lives the last hope of the \n",
      "Eldar, and while Gondolin stands Morgoth shall still know \n",
      "fear in his heart.' \n",
      "\n",
      "But Turgon answered: 'Not long now can Gondolin be \n",
      "hidden; and being discovered it must fall.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Huor spoke and said: 'Yet if it stands but a little \n",
      "while, then out of your house shall come the hope of Elves \n",
      "and Men. This I say to you, lord, with the eyes of death: \n",
      "though we part here for ever, and I shall not look on your \n",
      "white walls again, from you and from me a new star shall \n",
      "arise. Farewell!' \n",
      "\n",
      "And Maeglin, Turgon's sister-son, who stood by, heard \n",
      "these words, and did not forget them; but he said nothing. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Turgon took the counsel of Hurin and Huor, and \n",
      "summoning all that remained of the host of Gondolin and \n",
      "such of Fingon's people as could be gathered he retreated \n",
      "towards the Pass of Sirion; and his captains Ecthelion and \n",
      "Glorfindel guarded the flanks to right and left, so that none \n",
      "of the enemy should pass them by. But the Men of Dor- \n",
      "lomin held the rearguard, as Hurin and Huor desired; for \n",
      "they did not wish in their hearts to leave the Northlands, and \n",
      "if they could not win back to their homes, there they would \n",
      "stand to the end. Thus was the treachery of Uldor \n",
      "redressed; and of all the deeds of war that the fathers of \n",
      "Men wrought in behalf of the Eldar, the last stand of the Men \n",
      "of Dor-lomin is most renowned. \n",
      "\n",
      "So it was that Turgon fought his way southward, until \n",
      "coming behind the guard of Hurin and Huor he passed \n",
      "down Sirion and escaped; and he vanished into the \n",
      "mountains and was hidden from the eyes of Morgoth. But \n",
      "the brothers drew the remnant of the Men of the house of \n",
      "Hador about them, and foot by foot they withdrew, until they \n",
      "came behind the Fen of Serech, and had the stream of Rivil \n",
      "before them. There they stood and gave way no more. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then all the hosts of Angband swarmed against them, \n",
      "and they bridged the stream with their dead, and encircled \n",
      "the remnant of Hithlum as a gathering tide about a rock. \n",
      "There as the sun westered on the sixth day, and the \n",
      "shadow of Ered Wethrin grew dark, Huor fell pierced with a \n",
      "venomed arrow in his eye, and all the valiant Men of Hador \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "were slain about him in a heap; and the Ores hewed their \n",
      "heads and piled them as a mound of gold in the sunset. \n",
      "\n",
      "Last of all Hurin stood alone. Then he cast aside his \n",
      "shield, and wielded an axe two-handed; and it is sung that \n",
      "the axe smoked in the black blood of the troll-guard of \n",
      "Gothmog until it withered, and each time that he slew Hurin \n",
      "cried: 'Aure entuluva! Day shall come again!' Seventy \n",
      "times he uttered that cry; but they took him at last alive, by \n",
      "the command of Morgoth, for the Ores grappled him with \n",
      "their hands, which clung to him still though he hewed off \n",
      "their arms; and ever their numbers were renewed, until at \n",
      "last he fell buried beneath them. Then Gothmog bound him \n",
      "and dragged him to Angband with mockery. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus ended Nirnaeth Arnoediad, as the sun went down \n",
      "beyond the sea. Night fell in Hithlum, and there came a \n",
      "great storm of wind out of the West. \n",
      "\n",
      "Great was the triumph of Morgoth, and his design was \n",
      "accomplished in a manner after his own heart; for Men took \n",
      "the lives of Men, and betrayed the Eldar, and fear and \n",
      "hatred were aroused among those that should have been \n",
      "united against him. From that day the hearts of the Elves \n",
      "were estranged from Men, save only those of the Three \n",
      "Houses of the Edain. \n",
      "\n",
      "The realm of Fingon was no more; and the sons of \n",
      "Feanor wandered as leaves before the wind. Their arms \n",
      "were scattered, and their league broken; and they took to a \n",
      "wild and woodland life beneath the feet of Ered Lindon, \n",
      "mingling with the Green-elves of Ossiriand, bereft of their \n",
      "power and glory of old. In Brethil some few of the Haladin \n",
      "yet dwelt in the protection of their woods, and Handir son of \n",
      "Haldir was their lord; but to Hithlum came back never one of \n",
      "Fingon's host, nor any of the Men of Hador's house, nor any \n",
      "tidings of the battle and the fate of their lords. But Morgoth \n",
      "sent thither the Easterlings that had served him, denying \n",
      "them the rich lands of Beleriand which they coveted; and he \n",
      "shut them in Hithlum and forbade them to leave it. Such was \n",
      "the reward he gave them for their treachery to Maedhros: to \n",
      "plunder and harass the old and the women and the children \n",
      "of Hador's people. The remnant of the Eldar of Hithlum \n",
      "were taken to the mines of the north and laboured there as \n",
      "thralls, save some that eluded him and escaped into the \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "wilds and the mountains.' \n",
      "\n",
      "The Ores and the wolves went freely through all the \n",
      "North, and came ever further southward into Beleriand, \n",
      "even as far as Nantathren, the Land of Willows, and the \n",
      "borders of Ossiriand, and none were safe in field or wild. \n",
      "Doriath indeed remained, and the halls of Nargothrond \n",
      "were hidden; but Morgoth gave small heed to them, either \n",
      "because he knew little of them, or because their hour was \n",
      "not yet come in the deep purposes of his malice. Many now \n",
      "fled to the Havens and took refuge behind Cirdan's walls, \n",
      "and the mariners passed up and down the coast and \n",
      "harried the enemy with swift landings. But in the next year, \n",
      "ere the winter was come, Morgoth sent great strength over \n",
      "Hithlum and Nevrast, and they came down the rivers Brithon \n",
      "and Nenning and ravaged all the Falas, and besieged the \n",
      "walls of Brithombar and Eglarest. Smiths and miners and \n",
      "makers of fire they brought with them, and they set up great \n",
      "engines; and valiantly though they were resisted they broke \n",
      "the walls at last. Then the Havens were laid in ruin, and the \n",
      "tower of Barad Nimras cast down; and the most part of \n",
      "Cirdan's people were slain or enslaved. But some went \n",
      "aboard ship and escaped by sea; and among them was \n",
      "Ereinion Gil-galad, the son of Fingon, whom his father had \n",
      "sent to the Havens after the Dagor Bragollach. This \n",
      "remnant sailed with Cirdan south to the Isle of Balar, and \n",
      "they made a refuge for all that could come thither; for they \n",
      "kept a foothold also at the Mouths of Sirion, and there many \n",
      "light and swift ships lay hid in the creeks and waters where \n",
      "the reeds were dense as a forest. \n",
      "\n",
      "And when Turgon heard of this he sent again his \n",
      "messengers to Sirion's mouths, and besought the aid of \n",
      "Cirdan the Shipwright. At the bidding of Turgon Cirdan built \n",
      "seven swift ships, and they sailed out into the West; but no \n",
      "tidings of them came ever back to Balar, save of one, and \n",
      "the last. The mariners of that ship toiled long in the sea, and \n",
      "returning at last in despair they foundered in a great storm \n",
      "within sight of the coasts of Middle-earth; but one of them \n",
      "was saved by Ulmo from the wrath of Osse, and the waves \n",
      "bore him up, and cast him ashore in Nevrast. His name \n",
      "was Voronwe; and he was one of those that Turgon sent \n",
      "forth as messenqers from Gondolin. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the thought of Morgoth dwelt ever upon Turgon; \n",
      "for Turgon had escaped him, of ail his foes that one whom \n",
      "he most desired to take or to destroy. And that thought \n",
      "troubled him, and marred his victory, for Turgon of the \n",
      "mighty house of Fingolfin was now by right King of all the \n",
      "Noldor; and Morgoth feared and hated the house of \n",
      "Fingolfin, because they had the friendship of Ulmo his foe, \n",
      "and because of the wounds that Fingolfin gave him with his \n",
      "sword. And most of all his kin Morgoth feared Turgon; for of \n",
      "old in Valinor his eye had lighted upon him, and whenever \n",
      "he drew near a shadow had fallen on his spirit, foreboding \n",
      "that in some time that yet lay hidden, from Turgon ruin \n",
      "should come to him. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore Hurin was brought before Morgoth, for \n",
      "Morgoth knew that he had the friendship of the King of \n",
      "Gondolin; but Hurin defied him, and mocked him. Then \n",
      "Morgoth cursed Hurin and Morwen and their offspring, and \n",
      "set a doom upon them of darkness and sorrow; and taking \n",
      "Hurin from prison he set him in a chair of stone upon a high \n",
      "place of Thangorodrim. There he was bound by the power \n",
      "of Morgoth, and Morgoth standing beside him cursed him \n",
      "again; and he said: 'Sit now there; and look out upon the \n",
      "lands where evil and despair shall come upon those whom \n",
      "thou lovest. Thou hast dared to mock me, and to question \n",
      "the power of Melkor, Master of the fates of Arda. Therefore \n",
      "with my eyes thou shalt see, and with my ears thou shalt \n",
      "hear; and never shalt thou move from this place until all is \n",
      "fulfilled unto its bitter end.' \n",
      "\n",
      "And even so it came to pass; but it is not said that \n",
      "Hurin asked ever of Morgoth either mercy or death, for \n",
      "himself or for any of his kin. \n",
      "\n",
      "By the command of Morgoth the Ores with great labour \n",
      "gathered all the bodies of those who had fallen in the great \n",
      "battle, and all their harness and weapons, and piled them in \n",
      "a great mound in the midst of Anfauglith; and it was like a \n",
      "hill that could be seen from afar. Haudh-en-Ndengin the \n",
      "Elves named it, the Hill of Slain, and Haudh-en-Nirnaeth, \n",
      "the Hill of Tears. But grass came there and grew again long \n",
      "and green upon that hill, alone in all the desert that Morgoth \n",

      "earth beneath which the swords of the Eldar and the Edain \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Rian, daughter of Belegund, was the wife of Huor, son \n",
      "of Galdor; and she was wedded to him two months before \n",
      "he went with Hurin his brother to the Nirnaeth Arnoediad. \n",
      "When no tidings came of her lord she fled into the wild; but \n",
      "she was aided by the Grey-elves of Mithrim, and when her \n",
      "son Tuor was born they fostered him. Then Rian departed \n",
      "from Hithlum, and going to the Haudh-en-Ndengin she laid \n",
      "herself down upon it and died. \n",
      "\n",
      "Morwen, daughter of Baragund, was the wife of Hurin, \n",
      "Lord of Dor-lomin; and their son was Turin, who was born in \n",
      "the year that Beren Erchamion came upon Luthien in the \n",
      "Forest of Neldoreth. A daughter they had also who was \n",
      "called Lalaith, which is Laughter, and she was beloved by \n",
      "Turin her brother; but when she was three years old there \n",
      "came a pestilence to Hithlum, borne on an evil wind out of \n",
      "Angband, and she died. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Now after the Nimaeth Arnoediad Morwen abode still \n",
      "in Dor-lomin, for Turin was but eight years old, and she was \n",
      "again with child. Those days were evil; for the Easterlings \n",
      "that came into Hithlum despised the remnant of the people \n",
      "of Hador, and they oppressed them, and took their lands \n",
      "and their goods, and enslaved their children. But so great \n",
      "was the beauty and majesty of the Lady of Dor-lomin that \n",
      "the Easterlings were afraid, and dared not to lay hands \n",
      "upon her or her household; and they whispered among \n",
      "themselves, saying that she was perilous, and a witch \n",
      "skilled in magic and in league with the Elves. Yet she was \n",
      "now poor and without aid, save that she was succoured \n",
      "secretly by a kinswoman of Hurin named Aerin, whom \n",
      "Brodda, an Easterling, had taken as his wife; and Morwen \n",
      "feared greatly that Turin would be taken from her and \n",
      "enslaved. Therefore it came into her heart to send him \n",
      "away in secret, and to beg King Thingol to harbour him, for \n",
      "Beren son of Barahir was her father's kinsman, and he had \n",
      "been moreover a friend of Hurin, ere evil befell. Therefore in \n",
      "the autumn of the Year of Lamentation Morwen sent Turin \n",
      "forth over the mountains with two aged servants, bidding \n",
      "them find entry, if they could, into the kingdom of Doriath. \n",
      "Thus was the fate of Turin woven, which is fulltold in that lay \n",
      "that is called Nam i HTn Hurin, the Tale of the Children of \n",
      "Hurin, and is the longest of all the lays that speak of those \n",
      "days. Here that tale is told in brief, for it is woven with the \n",
      "fate of the Silmarils and of the Elves; and it is called the \n",
      "Tale of Grief, for it is sorrowful, and in it are revealed most \n",
      "evil works of Morgoth Bauglir. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the first beginning of the year Morwen gave birth to \n",
      "her child, the daughter of Hurin; and she named her Nienor, \n",
      "which is Mourning. But Turin and his companions passing \n",
      "through great perils came at last to the borders of Doriath; \n",
      "and there they were found by Beleg Strongbow, chief of the \n",
      "marchwardens of King Thingol, who led them to Menegroth. \n",
      "Then Thingol received Turin, and took him even to his own \n",
      "fostering, in honour of Hurin the Steadfast; for Thingol's \n",
      "mood was changed towards the houses of the Elf-friends. \n",
      "Thereafter messengers went north to Hithlum, bidding \n",
      "Morwen leave Dor-lomin and return with them to Doriath; \n",
      "but still she would not leave the house in which she had \n",
      "dwelt with Hurin. And when the Elves departed she sent \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "with them the Dragon-helm of Dor-lomin, greatest of the \n",
      "heirlooms of the house of Hador. \n",
      "\n",
      "Turin grew fair and strong in Doriath, but he was \n",
      "marked with sorrow. For nine years he dwelt in Thingol's \n",
      "halls, and during that time his grief grew less; for \n",
      "messengers went at times to Hithlum, and returning they \n",
      "brought better tidings of Morwen and Nienor. \n",
      "\n",
      "But there came a day when the messengers did not \n",
      "return out of die north, and Thingol would send no more. \n",
      "Then Turin was filled with fear for his mother and his sister, \n",
      "and in grimness of heart he went before the King and \n",
      "asked for mail and sword; and he put on the Dragon-helm \n",
      "of Dor-lomin and went out to battle on the marches of \n",
      "Doriath, and became the companion in arms of Beleg \n",
      "Cuthalion. \n",
      "\n",
      "And when three years had passed, Turin returned \n",
      "again to Menegroth; but he came from the wild, and was \n",
      "unkempt, and his gear and garments were way-worn. Now \n",
      "one there was in Doriath, of the people of the Nandor, high \n",
      "in the counsels of the King; Saeros was his name. He had \n",
      "long begrudged to Turin the honour he received as \n",
      "Thingol's fosterson; and seated opposite to him at the \n",
      "board he taunted him, saying: \n",
      "\n",
      "'If the Men of Hithlum are so wild and fell, of what sort \n",
      "are the women of that land? Do they run like deer clad only \n",
      "in their hair?' Then Turin in great anger took up a drinking- \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On the next day Saeros waylaid Turin as he set out \n",
      "from Menegroth to return to the marches; but Turin \n",
      "overcame him, and set him to run naked as a hunted beast \n",
      "through the woods. Then Saeros fleeing in terror before him \n",
      "fell into the chasm of a stream, and his body was broken on \n",
      "a great rock in the water. But others coming saw what was \n",
      "done, and Mablung was among them; and he bade Turin \n",
      "return with him to Menegroth and abide the judgement of \n",
      "the King, seeking his pardon. But Turin, deeming himself \n",
      "now an outlaw and fearing to be held captive, refused \n",
      "Mablung's bidding, and turned swiftly away; and passing \n",
      "through the Girdle of Melian he came into the woods west \n",
      "of Sirion. There he joined himself to a band of such \n",
      "houseless and desperate men as could be found in those \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "evil days lurking in the wild; and their hands were turned \n",
      "against all who came in their path Elves and Men and Ores. \n",
      "\n",
      "But when all that had befallen was told and searched \n",
      "out before Thingol, the King pardoned Turin, holding him \n",
      "wronged. In that time Beleg Strongbow returned from the \n",
      "north marches and came to Menegroth, seeking him; and \n",
      "Thingol spoke to Beleg, saying: 'I grieve, Cuthalion; for I \n",
      "took Hurin's son as my son, and so he shall remain, unless \n",
      "Hurin himself should return out of the shadows to claim his \n",
      "own. I would not have any say that Turin was driven forth \n",
      "unjustly into the wild, and gladly would I welcome him back; \n",
      "for I loved him well.' \n",
      "\n",
      "And Beleg answered: 'I will seek Turin until I find him, \n",
      "and I will bring him back to Menegroth, if I can; for I love him \n",
      "also.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Beleg departed from Menegroth, and far across \n",
      "Beleriand he sought in vain for tidings of Turin through \n",
      "many perils. \n",
      "\n",
      "But Turin abode long among the outlaws, and became \n",
      "their captain; and he named himself Neithan, the Wronged. \n",
      "Very warily they dwelt in the wooded lands south of Teiglin; \n",
      "but when a year had passed since Turin fled from Doriath, \n",
      "Beleg came upon their lair by night. It chanced that at that \n",
      "time Turin was gone from the camp; and the outlaws seized \n",
      "Beleg and bound him, and treated him cruelly, for they \n",
      "feared him as a spy of the King of Doriath. But Turin \n",
      "returning and seeing what was done, was stricken with \n",
      "remorse for all their evil and lawless deeds; and he \n",
      "released Beleg, and they renewed their friendship, and \n",
      "Turin foreswore thenceforward war or plunder against all \n",
      "save the servants of Angband. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Beleg told Turin of King Thingol's pardon; and he \n",
      "sought to persuade him by all means that he might to return \n",
      "with him to Doriath, saying that there was great need of his \n",
      "strength and valour on the north marches of the realm. 'Of \n",
      "late the Ores have found a way down out of Taur-nu-Fuin,' \n",
      "he said; 'they have made a road through the Pass of \n",
      "Anach.' \n",
      "\n",
      "'I do not remember it,' said Turin. \n",
      "\n",
      "'Never did we go so far from the borders,' said Beleg. \n",
      "'But you have seen the peaks of the Crissaegrim far off, \n",
      "and to the east the dark walls of the Gorgoroth. Anach lies \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "between, above the high springs of Mindeb, a hard and \n",
      "dangerous road; yet many come by it now, and Dimbar \n",
      "which used to be in peace is falling under the Black Hand, \n",
      "and the Men of Brethil are troubled. We are needed there.' \n",
      "\n",
      "But in the pride of his heart Turin refused the pardon of \n",
      "the King, and the words of Beleg were of no avail to change \n",
      "his mood. And he for his part urged Beleg to remain with \n",
      "him in the lands west of Sirion; but that Beleg would not do, \n",
      "and he said: 'Hard you are, Turin, and stubborn. Now the \n",
      "turn is mine. If you wish indeed to have the Strongbow \n",
      "beside you, look for me in Dimbar; for thither I shall return.' \n",
      "\n",
      "On the next day Beleg set out, and Turin went with him \n",
      "a bowshot from the camp; but he said nothing. 'Is it farewell, \n",
      "then, son of Hurin?' said Beleg. Then Turin looked out \n",
      "westward, and he saw far off the great height of Amon \n",
      "Rudh; and unwitting of what lay before him he answered: \n",
      "'You have said, seek me in Dimbar. But I say, seek for me \n",
      "on Amon Rudh! Else, this is our last farewell.' Then they \n",
      "parted, in friendship, yet in sadness. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now Beleg returned to the Thousand Caves, and \n",
      "coming before Thingol and Melian he told them of all that \n",
      "had befallen, save only of his evil handling by Turin's \n",
      "companions. Then Thingol sighed, and he said: \n",
      "\n",
      "'What more would Turin have me do?' \n",
      "\n",
      "'Give me leave, lord,' said Beleg, 'and I will guard him \n",
      "and guide him as I may; then no man shall say that elven- \n",
      "words are lightly spoken. Nor would I wish to see so great a \n",
      "good run to nothing in the wild.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Thingol gave Beleg leave to do as he would; and \n",
      "he said: 'Beleg Cuthalion! For many deeds you have \n",
      "earned my thanks; but not the least is the finding of my \n",
      "fosterson. At this parting ask for any gift, and I will not deny \n",
      "it to you.' \n",
      "\n",
      "'I ask then for a sword of worth,' said Beleg; 'for the \n",
      "Ores come now too thick and close for a bow only, and \n",
      "such blade as I have is no match for their armour.' \n",
      "\n",
      "'Choose from all that I have,' said Thingol, 'save only \n",
      "Aranruth, my own.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Beleg chose Anglachel; and that was a sword of \n",
      "great worth, and it was so named because it was made of \n",
      "iron that fell from heaven as a blazing star; it would cleave \n",
      "all earth-delved iron. One other sword only in Middle-earth \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "was like to it. That sword does not enter into this tale, \n",
      "though it was made of the same ore by the same smith; \n",
      "and that smith was Eol the Dark Elf, who took Aredhel \n",
      "Turgon's sister to wife. He gave Anglachel to Thingol as \n",
      "fee, which he begrudged, for leave to dwell in Nan Elmoth; \n",
      "but its mate Anguirel he kept, until it was stolen from him by \n",
      "Maeglin, his son. \n",
      "\n",
      "But as Thingol turned the hilt of Anglachel towards \n",
      "Beleg, Melian looked at the blade; and she said: There is \n",
      "malice in this sword. The dark heart of the smith still dwells \n",
      "in it. It will not love the hand it serves; neither will it abide \n",
      "with you long.' \n",
      "\n",
      "'Nonetheless I will wield it while I may,' said Beleg. \n",
      "\n",
      "'Another gift I will give to you, Cuthalion,' said Melian, \n",
      "'that shall be your help in the wild, and the help also of those \n",
      "whom you choose.' And she gave him store of lembas, the \n",
      "waybread of the Elves, wrapped in leaves of silver, and the \n",
      "threads that bound it were sealed at the knots with the seal \n",
      "of the Queen, a wafer of white wax shaped as a single \n",
      "flower of Telperion; for according to the customs of the \n",
      "Eldalie the keeping and giving of lembas belonged to the \n",
      "Queen alone. In nothing did Melian show greater favour to \n",
      "Turin than in this gift; for the Eldar had never before allowed \n",
      "Men to use this waybread, and seldom did so again. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Beleg departed with these gifts from Menegroth \n",
      "and went back to the north marches, where he had his \n",
      "lodges, and many friends. Then in Dimbar the Ores were \n",
      "driven back, and Anglachel rejoiced to be unsheathed; but \n",
      "when the winter came, and war was stilled, suddenly his \n",
      "companions missed Beleg, and he returned to them no \n",
      "more. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now when Beleg parted from the outlaws and returned \n",
      "into Doriath, Turin led them away westward out of Sirion's \n",
      "vale; for they grew weary of their life without rest, ever \n",
      "watchful and in fear of pursuit, and they sought for a safer \n",
      "lair. And it chanced at a time of evening that they came \n",
      "upon three Dwarves, who fled before them; but one that \n",
      "lagged behind was seized and thrown down, and a man of \n",
      "the company took his bow and let fly an arrow at the others \n",
      "as they vanished in the dusk. Now the dwarf that they had \n",
      "taken was named MTm; and he pleaded for his life before \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Turin, and offered as ransom to lead them to his hidden \n",
      "halls which none might find without his aid. Then Turin pitied \n",
      "MTm, and spared him; and he said: 'Where is your house?' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Mim answered: 'High above the lands lies the \n",
      "house of Mim, upon the great hill; Amon Rudh is that hill \n",
      "called now, since the Elves changed all the names.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Turin was silent, and he looked long upon the \n",
      "dwarf; and at last he said: 'You shall bring us to that place.' \n",
      "\n",
      "On the next day they set out thither, following Mim to \n",
      "Amon Rudh. Now that hill stood upon the edge of the \n",
      "moorlands that rose between the vales of Sirion and Narog, \n",
      "and high above the stony heath it reared its crown; but its \n",
      "steep grey head was bare, save for the red seregon that \n",
      "mantled the stone. And as the men of Turin's band drew \n",
      "near, the sun westering broke through the clouds, and fell \n",
      "upon the crown; and the seregon was all in flower. Then \n",
      "nnfi amnnn thpm Raid - 'Thprp is hlnnrl on thp hill-tnn ' \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But MTm led them by secret paths up the steep slopes \n",
      "of Amon Rudh; and at the mouth of his cave he bowed to \n",
      "Turin, saying: 'Enter into Bar-en-Danwedh, the House of \n",
      "Ransom; for so it shall be called.' \n",
      "\n",
      "And now there came another dwarf bearing light to \n",
      "greet him, and they spoke together, and passed swiftly \n",
      "down into the darkness of the cave; but Turin followed after, \n",
      "and came at length to a chamber far within, lit by dim lamps \n",
      "hanging upon chains. There he found Mim kneeling at a \n",
      "stone couch beside the wall, and he tore his beard, and \n",
      "wailed, crying one name unceasingly; and on the couch \n",
      "there lay a third. But Turin entering stood beside Mim, and \n",
      "offered him aid. Then Mim looked up at him, and said: 'You \n",
      "can give no aid. For this is KhTm, my son; and he is dead, \n",
      "pierced by an arrow. He died at sunset. Ibun my son has \n",
      "told me.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then pity rose in Turin's heart, and he said to Mim: \n",
      "'Alas! I would recall that shaft, if I could. Now Bar-en- \n",
      "Danwedh this house shall be called in truth; and if ever I \n",
      "come to any wealth, I will pay you a ransom of gold for your \n",
      "son, in token of sorrow, though it gladden your heart no \n",
      "more.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Mim rose, and looked long at Turin. 'I hear you,' \n",
      "he said. 'You speak like a dwarf-lord of old; and at that I \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "marvel. Now my heart is cooled, though it is not glad; and in \n",
      "this house you may dwell, if you will; for I will pay my \n",
      "ransom.' \n",
      "\n",
      "So began the abiding of Turin in the hidden house of \n",
      "MTm upon Amon Rudh; and he walked on the greensward \n",
      "before the mouth of the cave, and looked out east, and \n",
      "west, and north. Northward he looked, and descried the \n",
      "Forest of Brethil climbing green about Amon Obel in its \n",
      "midst, and thither his eyes were drawn ever and again, he \n",
      "knew not why; for his heart was set rather to the north-west, \n",
      "where league upon league away on the skirts of the sky it \n",
      "seemed to him that he could glimpse the Mountains of \n",
      "Shadow, the walls of his home. But at evening Turin looked \n",
      "west into the sunset, as the sun rode down red into the \n",
      "hazes above the distant coasts, and the Vale of Narog lay \n",
      "deep in the shadows between. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the time that followed Turin spoke much with MTm, \n",
      "and sitting with him alone he listened to his lore and the tale \n",
      "of his life. For MTm came of Dwarves that were banished in \n",
      "ancient days from the great Dwarf-cities of the east, and \n",
      "long before the return of Morgoth they wandered westward \n",
      "into Beleriand; but they became diminished in stature and \n",
      "in smith-craft, and they took to lives of stealth, walking with \n",
      "bowed shoulders and furtive steps. Before the Dwarves of \n",
      "Nogrod and Belegost came west over the mountains the \n",
      "Elves of Beleriand knew not what these others were, and \n",
      "they hunted them, and slew them; but afterwards they let \n",
      "them alone, and they were called Noegyth Nibin, the Petty- \n",
      "Dwarves, in the Sindarin tongue. They loved none but \n",
      "themselves, and if they feared and hated the Ores, they \n",
      "hated the Eldar no less, and the Exiles most of all; for the \n",
      "Noldor, they said, had stolen their lands and their homes. \n",
      "Long ere King Finrod Felagund came over the Sea, the \n",
      "caves of Nargothrond were discovered by them, and by \n",
      "them its delving was begun; and beneath the crown of \n",
      "Amon Rudh, the Bald Hill, the slow hands of the Petty- \n",
      "Dwarves had bored and deepened the caves through the \n",
      "long years that they dwelt there, untroubled by the Grey- \n",
      "elves of the woods. But now at last they had dwindled and \n",
      "died out of Middle-earth, all save MTm and his two sons; \n",
      "and MTm was old even in the reckoning of Dwarves, old and \n",
      "forgotten. And in his halls the smithies were idle, and the \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "axes rusted, and their name was remembered only in \n",
      "ancient tales of Doriath and Nargothrond. \n",
      "\n",
      "But when the year drew on to midwinter, snow came \n",
      "down from the north heavier than they had known it in the \n",
      "river-vales, and Amon Rudh was covered deep; and they \n",
      "said that the winters worsened in Beleriand as the power of \n",
      "Angband grew. Then only the hardiest dared stir abroad; \n",
      "and some fell sick, and all were pinched with hunger. But in \n",
      "the dim dusk of a winter's day there appeared suddenly \n",
      "among them a man, as it seemed, of great bulk and girth, \n",
      "cloaked and hooded in white; and he walked up to the fire \n",
      "without a word. And when men sprang up in fear, he \n",
      "laughed, and threw back his hood, and beneath his wide \n",
      "cloak he bore a great pack; and in the light of the fire Turin \n",
      "looked again on the face of Beleg Cuthalion. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus Beleg returned once more to Turin, and their \n",
      "meeting was glad; and with him he brought out of Dimbar \n",
      "the Dragon-helm of Dor-lomin, thinking that it might lift \n",
      "Turin's thought again above his life in the wilderness as the \n",
      "leader of a petty company. But still Turin would not return to \n",
      "Doriath; and Beleg yielding to his love against his wisdom \n",
      "remained with him, and did not depart, and in that time he \n",
      "laboured much for the good of Turin's company. Those that \n",
      "were hurt or sick he tended, and gave to them the lembas \n",
      "of Melian; and they were quickly healed, for though the \n",
      "Grey-elves were less in skill and knowledge than the Exiles \n",
      "from Valinor, in the ways of the life of Middle-earth they had \n",
      "a wisdom beyond the reach of Men. And because Beleg \n",
      "was strong and enduring, farsighted in mind as in eye, he \n",
      "came to be held in honour among the outlaws; but the \n",
      "hatred of MTm for the Elf that had come into Bar-en- \n",
      "Danwedh grew ever greater, and he sat with Ibun his son in \n",
      "the deepest shadows of his house, speaking to none. But \n",
      "Turin paid now little heed to the Dwarf; and when winter \n",
      "passed, and spring came, they had sterner work to do. \n",
      "\n",
      "Who knows now the counsels of Morgoth? Who can \n",
      "measure the reach of his thought, who had been Melkor, \n",
      "mighty among the Ainur of the Great Song, and sat now, a \n",
      "dark lord upon a dark throne in the North, weighing in his \n",
      "malice all the tidings that came to him, and perceiving more \n",
      "of the deeds and purposes of his enemies than even the \n",
      "wisest of them feared, save only Melian the Queen? To her \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "often the thought of Morgoth reached out, and there was \n",
      "foiled. \n",
      "\n",
      "And now again the might of Angband was moved; and \n",
      "as the long fingers of a groping hand the forerunners of his \n",
      "armies probed the ways into Beleriand. Through Anach \n",
      "they came, and Dimbar was taken, and all the north \n",
      "marches of Doriath. Down the ancient road they came that \n",
      "led through the long defile of Sirion, past the isle where \n",
      "Minas Tirith of Finrod had stood, and so through the land \n",
      "between Malduin and Sirion, and on through the eaves of \n",
      "Brethil to the Crossings of Teiglin. Thence the road went on \n",
      "into the Guarded Plain; but the Ores did not go far upon it, \n",
      "as yet, for there dwelt now in the wild a terror that was \n",
      "hidden, and upon the red hill were watchful eyes of which \n",
      "they had not been warned. For Turin put on again the Helm \n",
      "of Hador; and far and wide in Beleriand the whisper went, \n",
      "under wood and over stream and through the passes of the \n",
      "hills, saying that the Helm and Bow that had fallen in \n",
      "Dimbar had arisen again beyond hope. Then many who \n",
      "went leaderless, dispossessed but undaunted, took heart \n",
      "again, and came to seek the Two Captains. Dor-Cuarthol, \n",
      "the Land of Bow and Helm, was in that time named all the \n",
      "region between Teiglin and the west march of Doriath; and \n",
      "Turin named himself anew, Gorthol, the Dread Helm, and \n",
      "his heart was high again. In Menegroth, and in the deep \n",
      "halls of Nargothrond, and even in the hidden realm of \n",
      "Gondolin, the fame of the deeds of the Two Captains was \n",
      "heard; and in Angband also they were known. Then \n",
      "Morgoth laughed, for now by the Dragon-helm was Hurin's \n",
      "son revealed to him again; and ere long Amon Rudh was \n",
      "ringed with spies. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the waning of the year MTm the Dwarf and Ibun his \n",
      "son went out from Bar-en-Danwedh to gather roots in the \n",
      "wild for their winter store; and they were taken captive by \n",
      "Ores. Then for a second time Mim promised to guide his \n",
      "enemies by the secret paths to his home on Amon Rudh; \n",
      "but yet he sought to delay the fulfilment of his promise, and \n",
      "demanded that Gorthol should not be slain. Then the Ore- \n",
      "captain laughed, and he said to Mim: 'Assuredly Turin son \n",
      "of Hurin shall not be slain.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus was Bar-en-Danwedh betrayed, for the Ores \n",
      "came upon it by night at unawares, guided by Mim. There \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "many of Turin's company were slain as they slept; but some \n",
      "fleeing by an inner stair came out upon the hill-top, and \n",
      "there they fought until they fell, and their blood flowed out \n",
      "upon the seregon that mantled the stone. But a net was \n",
      "cast over Turin as he fought, and he was enmeshed in it, \n",
      "and overcome, and led away. \n",
      "\n",
      "And at length when all was silent again MTm crept out \n",
      "of the shadows of his house; and as the sun rose over the \n",
      "mists of Sirion he stood beside the dead men on the hill- \n",
      "top. But he perceived that not all those that lay there were \n",
      "dead; for by one his gaze was returned, and he looked in \n",
      "the eyes of Beleg the Elf. Then with hatred long-stored MTm \n",
      "stepped up to Beleg, and drew forth the sword Anglachel \n",
      "that lay beneath the body of one that had fallen beside him; \n",
      "but Beleg stumbling up seized back the sword and thrust it \n",
      "at the Dwarf, and MTm in terror fled wailing from the hill-top. \n",
      "And Beleg cried after him: The vengeance of the house of \n",
      "Hador will find you yet!' \n",
      "\n",
      "Now Beleg was sorely wounded, but he was mighty \n",
      "among the Elves of Middle-earth, and he was moreover a \n",
      "master of healing. Therefore he did not die, and slowly his \n",
      "strength returned; and he sought in vain among the dead for \n",
      "Turin, to bury him. But he found him not; and then he knew \n",
      "that Hurin's son was yet alive, and taken to Angband. \n",
      "\n",
      "With little hope Beleg departed from Amon Rudh and \n",
      "set out northward, towards the Crossings of Teiglin, \n",
      "following in the track of the Ores; and he crossed over the \n",
      "Brithiach and journeyed through Dimbar towards the Pass \n",
      "of Anach. And now he was not far behind them, for he went \n",
      "without sleeping, whereas they had tarried on their road, \n",
      "hunting in the lands and fearing no pursuit as they came \n",
      "northward; and not even in the dreadful woods of Taur-nu- \n",
      "Fuin did he swerve from the trail, for the skill of Beleg was \n",
      "greater than any that have been in Middle-earth. But as he \n",
      "passed by night through that evil land he came upon one \n",
      "lying asleep at the foot of a great dead tree; and Beleg \n",
      "staying his steps beside the sleeper saw that it was an Elf. \n",
      "Then he spoke to him, and gave him lembas, and asked \n",
      "him what fate had brought him to that terrible place; and he \n",
      "named himself Gwindor, son of Guilin. \n",
      "\n",
      "Grieving Beleg looked upon him; for Gwindor was now \n",
      "but a bent and fearful shadow of his former shape and \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "mood, when in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad that lord of \n",
      "Nargothrond rode with rash courage to the very doors of \n",
      "Angband, and there was taken. For few of the Noldor whom \n",
      "Morgoth captured were put to death, because of their skill \n",
      "in forging and in mining for metals and gems; and Gwindor \n",
      "was not slain, but put to labour in the mines of the North. By \n",
      "secret tunnels known only to themselves the mining Elves \n",
      "might sometimes escape; and thus it came to pass that \n",
      "Beleg found him, spent and bewildered in the mazes of \n",
      "Taur-nu-Fuin.' \n",
      "\n",
      "And Gwindor told him that as he lay and lurked among \n",
      "the trees he saw a great company of Ores passing \n",
      "northwards, and wolves went with them; and among them \n",
      "was a Man, whose hands were chained, and they drove \n",
      "him onward with whips. 'Very tall he was', said Gwindor, 'as \n",
      "tall as are the Men from the misty hills of Hithlum.' Then \n",
      "Beleg told him of his own errand in Taur-nu-Fuin; and \n",
      "Gwindor sought to dissuade him from his quest, saying that \n",
      "he would but join Turin in the anguish that awaited him. But \n",
      "Beleg would not abandon Turin, and despairing himself he \n",
      "aroused hope again in Gwindor's heart; and together they \n",
      "went on, following the Ores until they came out of the forest \n",
      "on the high slopes that ran down to the barren dunes of \n",
      "Anfauglith. There within sight of the peaks of Thangorodrim \n",
      "the Ores made their encampment in a bare dell as the light \n",
      "of day was failing, and setting wolf-sentinels all about they \n",
      "fell to carousing. A great storm rode up out of the west, and \n",
      "lightning glittered on the Shadowy Mountains far away, as \n",
      "Beleg and Gwindor crept towards the dell. \n",
      "\n",
      "When all in the camp were sleeping Beleg took his \n",
      "bow, and in the darkness shot the wolf-sentinels, one by \n",
      "one and silently. Then in great peril they entered in, and \n",
      "they found Turin fettered hand and foot and tied to a \n",
      "withered tree; and all about him knives that had been cast \n",
      "at him were embedded in the trunk, and he was senseless \n",
      "in a sleep of great weariness. But Beleg and Gwindor cut \n",
      "the bonds that held him, and lifting him they carried him out \n",
      "of the dell; yet they could bear him no further than to a \n",
      "thicket of thorn-trees a little way above. There they laid him \n",
      "down; and now the storm drew very near. Beleg drew his \n",
      "sword Anglachel, and with it he cut the fetters that bound \n",
      "Turin; but fate was that day more strong, for the blade \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "slipped as he cut the shackles, and Turin's foot was \n",
      "pricked. Then he was aroused into a sudden wakefulness \n",
      "of rage and fear, and seeing one bending over him with \n",
      "naked blade he leapt up with a great cry, believing that \n",
      "Ores were come again to torment him; and grappling with \n",
      "him in the darkness he seized Anglachel, and slew Beleg \n",
      "Cuthalion thinking him a foe. \n",
      "\n",
      "But as he stood, finding himself free, and ready to sell \n",
      "his life dearly against imagined foes, there came a great \n",
      "flash of lightning above them; and in its light he looked \n",
      "down on Beleg's face. Then Turin stood stone-still and \n",
      "silent, staring on that dreadful death, knowing what he had \n",
      "done; and so terrible was his face, lit by the lightning that \n",
      "flickered all about them, that Gwindor cowered down upon \n",
      "the ground and dared not raise his eyes.' \n",
      "\n",
      "But now in the dell beneath the Ores were aroused, \n",
      "and all the camp was in a tumult; for they feared the thunder \n",
      "that came out of the west, believing that it was sent against \n",
      "them by the great Enemies beyond the Sea. Then a wind \n",
      "arose, and great rains fell, and torrents swept down from \n",
      "the heights of Taur-nu-Fuin; and though Gwindor cried out \n",
      "to Turin, warning him of their utmost peril, he made no \n",
      "answer, but sat unmoving and unweeping in the tempest \n",
      "beside the body of Beleg Cuthalion. \n",
      "\n",
      "When morning came the storm was passed away \n",
      "eastward over Lothlann, and the sun of autumn rose hot and \n",
      "bright; but believing that Turin would have fled far away from \n",
      "that place and all trace of his flight be washed away, the \n",
      "Ores departed in haste without longer search, and far off \n",
      "Gwindor saw them marching away over the steaming \n",
      "sands of Anfauglith. Thus it came to pass that they returned \n",
      "to Morgoth empty-handed, and left behind them the son of \n",
      "Hurin, who sat crazed and unwitting on the slopes of Taur- \n",
      "nu-Fuin, bearing a burden heavier than their bonds. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Gwindor roused Turin to aid him in the burial of \n",
      "Beleg, and he rose as one that walked in sleep; and \n",
      "together they laid Beleg in a shallow grave, and placed \n",
      "beside him Belthronding his great bow, that was made of \n",
      "black yew-wood. But the dread sword Anglachel Gwindor \n",
      "took, saying that it were better that it should take \n",
      "vengeance on the servants of Morgoth than lie useless in \n",
      "the earth; and he took also the lembas of Melian to \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "strengthen them in the wild. \n",

      "\n",
      "Beleglt Slain -aÂ»wkhi 6 1M Ntimith. All ngbU n*rwd. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus ended Beleg Strongbow, truest of friends, \n",
      "greatest in skill of all that harboured in the woods of \n",
      "Beleriand in the Elder Days, at the hand of him whom he \n",
      "most loved; and that grief was graven on the face of Turin \n",
      "and never faded. But courage and strength were renewed \n",
      "in the Elf of Nargothrond, and departing from Taur-nu-Fuin \n",
      "he led Turin far away. Never once as they wandered \n",
      "together on long and grievous paths did Turin speak, and \n",
      "he walked as one without wish or purpose, while the year \n",
      "waned and winter drew on over the northern lands. But \n",
      "Gwindor was ever beside him to guard him and guide him; \n",
      "and thus they passed westward over Sirion and came at \n",
      "length to Eithel Ivrin, the springs whence Narog rose \n",
      "beneath the Mountains of Shadow. There Gwindor spoke to \n",
      "Turin, saying: 'Awake, Turin son of Hurin Thalion! On Ivrin's \n",
      "lake is endless laughter. She is fed from crystal fountains \n",
      "unfailing, and guarded from defilement by Ulmo, Lord of \n",
      "Waters, who wrought her beauty in ancient days.' Then \n",
      "Turin knelt and drank from that water; and suddenly he cast \n",
      "himself down, and his tears were unloosed at last, and he \n",
      "was healed of his madness. \n",
      "\n",
      "There he made a song for Beleg, and he named it \n",
      "LaerCu Beleg, the Song of the Great Bow, singing it aloud \n",
      "heedless of peril. And Gwindor gave the sword Anglachel \n",
      "into his hands, and Turin knew that it was heavy and strong \n",
      "and had great power; but its blade was black and dull and \n",
      "its edges blunt. Then Gwindor said: 'This is a strange \n",
      "blade, and unlike any that I have seen in Middle-earth. It \n",
      "mourns for Beleg even as you do. But be comforted; for I \n",
      "return to Nargothrond of the house of Finarfin, and you shall \n",
      "come with me, and be healed and renewed.' \n",
      "\n",
      "'Who are you?' said Turin. \n",
      "\n",
      "'A wandering Elf, a thrall escaped, whom Beleg met \n",
      "and comforted,' said Gwindor. 'Yet once I was Gwindor son \n",
      "of Guilin, a lord of Nargothrond, until I went to the Nirnaeth \n",
      "Amoediad, and was enslaved in Angband.' \n",
      "\n",
      "'Then have you seen Hurin son of Galdor, the warrior of \n",
      "Dor-lomin?' said Turin. \n",
      "\n",
      "'I have not seen him,' said Gwindor. 'But rumour of him \n",
      "runs through Angband that he still defies Morgoth; and \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Morgoth has laid a curse upon turn and all his kin.' \n",
      "\n",
      "That I do believe,' said Turin. \n",
      "\n",
      "And now they arose, and departing from Eithel Ivrin \n",
      "they journeyed southward along the banks of Narog, until \n",
      "they were taken by scouts of the Elves and brought as \n",
      "prisoners to the hidden stronghold. Thus did Turin come to \n",
      "Nargothrond. \n",
      "\n",
      "At first his own people did not know Gwindor, who \n",
      "went out young and strong, and returned now seeming as \n",
      "one of the aged among mortal Men, because of his \n",
      "torments and his labours; but Finduilas daughter of \n",
      "Orodreth the King knew him and welcomed him, for she \n",
      "had loved him before the Nirnaeth, and so greatly did \n",
      "Gwindor love her beauty that he named her Faelivrin, which \n",
      "is the gleam of the sun on the pools of Ivrin. For Gwindor's \n",
      "sake Turin was admitted with him into Nargothrond, and he \n",
      "dwelt there in honour. But when Gwindor would tell his \n",
      "name, Turin checked him, saying: 'I am Agarwaen the son \n",
      "of Umarth (which is the Bloodstained, son of Ill-fate), a \n",
      "hunter in the woods'; and the Elves of Nargothrond \n",
      "questioned him no more. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the time that followed Turin grew high in favour with \n",
      "Orodreth, and well-nigh all hearts were turned to him in \n",
      "Nargothrond. For he was young, and only now reached his \n",
      "full manhood; and he was in truth the son of Morwen \n",
      "Eledhwen to look upon: dark-haired and pale-skinned, with \n",
      "grey eyes, and his face more beautiful than any other \n",
      "among mortal Men, in the Elder Days. His speech and \n",
      "bearing were that of the ancient kingdom of Doriath, and \n",
      "even among the Elves he might be taken for one from the \n",
      "great houses of the Noldor; therefore many called him \n",
      "Adanedhel, the Elf-Man. The sword Anglachel was forged \n",
      "anew for him by cunning smiths of Nargothrond, and though \n",
      "ever black its edges shone with pale fire; and he named it \n",
      "Gurthang, Iron of Death. So great was his prowess and skill \n",
      "in warfare on the confines of the Guarded Plain that he \n",
      "himself became known as Mormegil, the Black Sword; and \n",
      "the Elves said: 'The Mormegil cannot be slain, save by \n",
      "mischance, or an evil arrow from afar.' Therefore they gave \n",
      "him dwarf-mail, to guard him; and in a grim mood he found \n",
      "also in the armouries a dwarf-mask all gilded, and he put it \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "on before battle, and his enemies fled before his face. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the heart of Finduilas was turned from Gwindor \n",
      "and against her will her love was given to Turin; but Turin \n",
      "did not perceive what had befallen. And being torn in heart \n",
      "Finduilas became sorrowful; and she grew wan and silent. \n",
      "But Gwindor sat in dark thought; and on a time he spoke to \n",
      "Finduilas, saying: 'Daughter of the house of Finarfin, let no \n",
      "grief lie between us; for though Morgoth has laid my life in \n",
      "ruin, you still I love. Go whither love leads you; yet beware! It \n",
      "is not fitting that the Elder Children of lluvatar should wed \n",
      "with the Younger; nor is it wise, for they are brief, and soon \n",
      "pass, to leave us in widowhood while the world lasts. \n",
      "Neither will fate suffer it, unless it be once or twice only, for \n",
      "some high cause of doom that we do not perceive. But this \n",
      "Man is not Beren. A doom indeed lies on him, as seeing \n",
      "eyes may well read in him, but a dark doom. Enter not into \n",
      "it! And if you will, your love shall betray you to bitterness and \n",
      "death. For hearken to me! Though he be indeed agamaen \n",
      "son of umarth, his right name is Turin son of Hurin, whom \n",
      "Morgoth holds in Angband, and whose kin he has cursed. \n",
      "Doubt not the power of Morgoth Bauglir! Is it not written in \n",
      "me?' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Finduilas sat long in thought; but at the last she \n",
      "said only: 'Turin son of Hurin loves me not; nor will.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Now when Turin learnt from Finduilas of what had \n",
      "passed, he was wrathful, and he said to Gwindor: 'In love I \n",
      "hold you for rescue and safe-keeping. But now you have \n",
      "done ill to me, friend, to betray my right name, and call my \n",
      "doom upon me, from which I would lie hid.' \n",
      "\n",
      "But Gwindor answered: 'The doom lies in yourself, not \n",
      "in your name.' \n",
      "\n",
      "When it became known to Orodreth that the Mormegil \n",
      "was in truth the son of Hurin Thalion he gave him great \n",
      "honour, and Turin became mighty among the people of \n",
      "Nargothrond. But he had no liking for their manner of \n",
      "warfare, of ambush and stealth and secret arrow, and he \n",
      "yearned for brave strokes and battle in the open; and his \n",
      "counsels weighed with the King ever the longer the more. In \n",
      "those days the Elves of Nargothrond forsook their secrecy \n",
      "and went openly to battle, and great store of weapons were \n",
      "made; and by the counsel of Turin the Noldor built a mighty \n",
      "bridge over the Narog from the Doors of Felagund, for the \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "swifter passage of their arms. Then the servants of \n",
      "Angband were driven out of all the land between Narog and \n",
      "Sirion eastward, and westward to the Nenning and the \n",
      "desolate Falas; and though Gwindor spoke ever against \n",
      "Turin in the council of the King, holding it an ill policy, he fell \n",
      "into dishonour and none heeded him, for his strength was \n",
      "small and he was no longer forward in arms. Thus \n",
      "Nargothrond was revealed to the wrath and hatred of \n",
      "Morgoth; but still at Turin's prayer his true name was not \n",
      "spoken, and though the fame of his deeds came into \n",
      "Doriath and to the ears of Thingol, rumour spoke only of the \n",
      "Black Sword of Nargothrond. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In that time of respite and hope, when because of the \n",
      "deeds of the Mormegil the power of Morgoth was stemmed \n",
      "west of Sirion, Morwen fled at last from Dor-lomin with \n",
      "Nienor her daughter, and adventured the long journey to \n",
      "Thingol's halls. There new grief awaited her, for she found \n",
      "Turin gone, and to Doriath there had come no tidings since \n",
      "the Dragon-helm had vanished from the lands west of \n",
      "Sirion; but Morwen remained in Doriath with Nienor as \n",
      "guests of Thingol and Melian, and were treated with honour. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now it came to pass, when four hundred and ninety- \n",
      "five years had passed since the rising of the Moon, in the \n",
      "spring of the year, there came to Nargothrond two Elves, \n",
      "named Gelmir and Arminas; they were of Angrod's people, \n",
      "but since the Dagor Bragollach they dwelt in the south with \n",
      "Cirdan the Shipwright. From their far journeys they brought \n",
      "tidings of a great mustering of Ores and evil creatures \n",
      "under the eaves of Ered Wethrin and in the Pass of Sirion; \n",
      "and they told also that Ulmo had come to Cirdan, giving \n",
      "warning that great peril drew nigh to Nargothrond. \n",
      "\n",
      "'Flear the words of the Lord of Waters!' said they to the \n",
      "King. 'Thus he spoke to Cirdan the Shipwright: 'The Evil of \n",
      "the North has defiled the springs of Sirion, and my power \n",
      "withdraws from the fingers of the flowing waters. But a \n",
      "worse thing is yet to come forth. Say therefore to the Lord \n",
      "of Nargothrond: Shut the doors of the fortress and go not \n",
      "abroad. Cast the stones of your pride into the loud river, \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "that the creeping evil may not find the gate.\"' \n",
      "\n",
      "Orodreth was troubled by the dark words of the \n",
      "messengers, but Turin would by no means hearken to these \n",
      "counsels, and least of all would he suffer the great bridge to \n",
      "be cast down; for he was become proud and stern, and \n",
      "would order all things as he wished. \n",
      "\n",
      "Soon afterwards Handir Lord of Brethil was slain, for \n",
      "the Ores invaded his land, and Handir gave them battle; but \n",
      "the Men of Brethil were worsted, and driven back into their \n",
      "woods. And in the autumn of the year, biding his hour, \n",
      "Morgoth loosed upon the people of Narog the great host \n",
      "that he had long prepared; and Glaurung the Uruloki \n",
      "passed over Anfauglith, and came thence into the north \n",
      "vales of Sirion and there did great evil. Under the shadows \n",
      "of Ered Wethrin he defiled the Eithel Ivrin, and thence he \n",
      "passed into the realm of Nargothrond, and burned the \n",
      "Talath Dirnen, the Guarded Plain, between Narog and \n",
      "Teiglin. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the warriors of Nargothrond went forth, and tall \n",
      "and terrible on that day looked Turin, and the heart of the \n",
      "host was upheld, as he rode on the right hand of Orodreth. \n",
      "But greater far was the host of Morgoth than any scouts had \n",
      "told, and none but Turin defended by his dwarf-mask could \n",
      "withstand the approach of Glaurung; and the Elves were \n",
      "driven back and pressed by the Ores into the field of \n",
      "Tumhalad, between Ginglith and Narog, and there they \n",
      "were penned. On that day all the pride and host of \n",
      "Nargothrond withered away; and Orodreth was slain in the \n",
      "forefront of the battle, and Gwindor son of Guilin was \n",
      "wounded to the death. But Turin came to his aid, and all \n",
      "fled before him; and he bore Gwindor out of the rout, and \n",
      "escaping into a wood there laid him on the grass. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Gwindor said to Turin: 'Let bearing pay for \n",
      "bearing! But ill-fated was mine, and vain is thine; for my \n",
      "body is marred beyond healing, and I must leave Middle- \n",
      "earth. And though I love thee, son of Hurin, yet I rue the day \n",
      "that I took thee from the Ores. But for thy prowess and thy \n",
      "pride, still I should have love and life, and Nargothrond \n",
      "should yet stand a while.' Now if thou love me, leave me! \n",
      "Haste thee to Nargothrond, and save Finduilas. And this \n",
      "last I say to thee: she alone stands between thee and thy \n",
      "doom. If thou fail her, it shall not fail to find thee. Farewell!' \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Turin sped back to Nargothrond, mustering such \n",
      "of the rout as he met with on the way; and the leaves fell \n",
      "from the trees in a great wind as they went, for the autumn \n",
      "was passing to a dire winter. But the host of the Ores and \n",
      "Glaurung the Dragon were there before him, and they came \n",
      "suddenly, ere those that were left on guard were aware of \n",
      "what had befallen on the field of Tumhalad. In that day the \n",
      "bridge over Narog proved an evil; for it was great and \n",
      "mightily made and could not swiftly be destroyed, and the \n",
      "enemy came readily over the deep river, and Glaurung \n",
      "came in full fire against the Doors of Felagund, and \n",
      "overthrew them, and passed within. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "And even as Turin came up the dreadful sack of \n",
      "Nargothrond was well nigh achieved. The Ores had slain or \n",
      "driven off all that remained in arms, and were even then \n",
      "ransacking the great halls and chambers, plundering and \n",
      "destroying; but those of the women and maidens that were \n",
      "not burned or slain they had herded on the terraces before \n",
      "the doors, as slaves to be taken into Morgoth's thraldom. \n",
      "Upon this ruin and woe Turin came, and none could \n",
      "withstand him; or would not, though he struck down all \n",
      "before him, and passed over the bridge, and hewed his \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "way towards the captives. \n",
      "\n",
      "And now he stood alone, for the few that followed him \n",
      "had fled. But in that moment Glaurung issued from the \n",
      "gaping doors, and lay behind, between Turin and the \n",
      "bridge. Then suddenly he spoke, by the evil spirit that was \n",
      "in him, saying: 'Hail, son of Hurin. Well met!' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Turin sprang about, and strode against him, and \n",
      "the edges of Gurthang shone as with flame; but Glaurung \n",
      "withheld his blast, and opened wide his serpent-eyes and \n",
      "gazed upon Turin. Without fear Turin looked into them as he \n",
      "raised up the sword; and straightway he fell under the \n",
      "binding spell of the lidless eyes of the dragon, and was \n",
      "halted moveless. Then for a long time he stood as one \n",
      "graven of stone; and they two were alone, silent before the \n",
      "doors of Nargothrond. But Glaurung spoke again, taunting \n",
      "Turin, and he said: 'Evil have been all thy ways, son of \n",
      "Hurin. Thankless fosterling, outlaw, slayer of thy friend, thief \n",
      "of love, usurper of Nargothrond, captain foolhardy, and \n",
      "deserter of thy kin. As thralls thy mother and thy sister live in \n",
      "Dor-lomin, in misery and want. Thou art arrayed as a \n",
      "prince, but they go in rags; and for thee they yearn, but thou \n",
      "carest not for that. Glad may thy father be to learn that he \n",
      "hath such a son; as learn he shall.' And Turin being under \n",
      "the spell of Glaurung hearkened to his words, and he saw \n",
      "himself as in a mirror misshapen by malice, and loathed \n",
      "that which he saw. \n",
      "\n",
      "And while he was yet held by the eyes of the dragon in \n",
      "torment of mind, and could not stir, the Ores drove away the \n",
      "herded captives, and they passed nigh to Turin and \n",
      "crossed over the bridge. Among them was Finduilas, and \n",
      "she cried out to Turin as she went; but not until her cries \n",
      "and the wailing of the captives was lost upon the northward \n",
      "road did Claiming release Turin, and he might not stop his \n",
      "ears against that voice that haunted him after. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then suddenly Glaurung withdrew his glance, and \n",
      "waited; and Turin stirred slowly, as one waking from a \n",
      "hideous dream. Then coming to himself he sprang upon the \n",
      "dragon with a cry. But Glaurung laughed, saying: 'If thou wilt \n",
      "be slain, I will slay thee gladly. But small help will that be to \n",
      "Morwen and Nienor. No heed didst thou give to the cries of \n",
      "the Elf-woman. Wilt thou deny also the bond of thy blood?' \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But Turin drawing back his sword stabbed at the \n",
      "dragon's eyes; and Glaurung coiling back swiftly towered \n",
      "above him, and said: 'Nay! At least thou art valiant; beyond \n",
      "all whom I have met And they lie who say that we of our part \n",
      "do not honour the valour of foes. See now! I offer thee \n",
      "freedom. Go to thy kin, if thou canst. Get thee gone! And if \n",
      "Elf or Man be left to make tale of these days, then surely in \n",
      "scorn they will name thee, if thou spumest this gift.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Turin, being yet bemused by the eyes of the \n",
      "dragon, as were he treating with a foe that could know pity, \n",
      "believed the words of Glaurung and fuming away he sped \n",
      "over the bridge. But as he went Glaurung spoke behind \n",
      "him, saying in a fell voice: 'Haste thee now, son of Hurin, to \n",
      "Dor-lomin! Or perhaps the Ores shall come before thee, \n",
      "once again. And if thou tarry for Finduilas, then never shalt \n",
      "thou see Morwen again, and never at all shalt thou see \n",
      "Nienor thy sister; and they will curse thee.' \n",
      "\n",
      "But Turin passed away on the northward road, and \n",
      "Glaurung laughed once more, for he had accomplished the \n",
      "errand of his Master. Then he turned to his own pleasure, \n",
      "and sent forth his blast, and burned all about him. But all the \n",
      "Ores that were busy in the sack he routed forth, and drove \n",
      "them away, and denied them their plunder even to the last \n",
      "thing of worth. The bridge then he broke down and cast into \n",
      "the foam of Narog; and being thus secure he gathered all \n",
      "the hoard and riches of Felagund and heaped them, and \n",
      "lay upon them in the innermost hall, and rested a while. \n",
      "\n",
      "And Turin hastened along the ways to the north, \n",
      "through the lands now desolate between Narog and Teiglin, \n",
      "and the Fell Winter came down to meet him; for in that year \n",
      "snow fell ere autumn was passed, and spring came late \n",
      "and cold. Ever it seemed to him as he went that he heard \n",
      "the cries of Finduilas, calling his name by wood and hill, \n",
      "and great was his anguish; but his heart being hot with the \n",
      "lies of Glaurung, and seeing ever in his mind the Ores \n",
      "burning the house of Hurin or putting Morwen and Nienor to \n",
      "torment, he held on his way, and turned never aside. \n",
      "\n",
      "At last worn by haste and the long road (for forty \n",
      "leagues and more had he journeyed without rest) he came \n",
      "with the first ice of winter to the pools of Ivrin, where before \n",
      "he had been healed. But they were now but a frozen mire, \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "and he could drink there no more.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus he came hardly by the passes of Dor-lomin, \n",
      "through bitter snows from the north, and found again the \n",
      "land of his childhood. Bare and bleak it was; and Morwen \n",
      "was gone. Her house stood empty, broken and cold; and \n",
      "no living thing dwelt nigh. Therefore Turin departed, and \n",
      "came to the house of Brodda the Easterling, he that had to \n",
      "wife Aerin, Hurin's kinswoman; and there he learned of an \n",
      "old servant that Morwen was long gone, for she had fled \n",
      "with Nienor out of Dor-Lomin, none but Aerin knew where. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Turin strode to Brodda's table, and seizing him \n",
      "he drew his sword, and demanded that he be told whither \n",
      "Morwen had gone; and Aerin declared to him that she went \n",
      "to Doriath to seek her son. 'For the lands were freed then \n",
      "from evil,' she said, 'by the Black Sword of the south, who \n",
      "now has fallen, they say.' Then Turin's eyes were opened, \n",
      "and the last threads of Glaurung's spell were loosed; and \n",
      "for anguish, and wrath at the lies that had deluded him, and \n",
      "hatred of the oppressors of Morwen, a black rage seized \n",
      "him, and he slew Brodda in his hall, and other Easterlings \n",
      "that were his guests. Thereafter he fled out into the winter, a \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hunted man; but he was aided by some that remained of \n",
      "Hador's people and knew the ways of the wild, and with \n",
      "them he escaped through the falling snow and came to an \n",
      "outlaws' refuge in the southern mountains of Dor-lomin. \n",
      "Thence Turin passed again from the land of his childhood, \n",
      "and returned to Sirion's vale. His heart was bitter, for to \n",
      "Dor-lomin he had brought only greater woe upon the \n",
      "remnant of his people, and they were glad of his going; and \n",
      "this comfort alone he had: that by the prowess of the Black \n",
      "Sword the ways to Doriath had been laid open to Morwen. \n",
      "And he said in his thought: Then those deeds wrought not \n",
      "evil to all. And where else might I have better bestowed my \n",
      "kin, even had I come sooner? For if the Girdle of Melian be \n",
      "broken, then last hope is ended. Nay, it is better indeed as \n",
      "things be; for a shadow I cast wheresoever I come. Let \n",
      "Melian keep them! And I will leave them in peace \n",
      "unshadowed for a while.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Now Turin coming down from Ered Wethrin sought for \n",
      "Finduilas in vain, roaming the woods beneath the \n",
      "mountains, wild and wary as a beast; and he waylaid all the \n",
      "roads that went north to the Pass of Sirion. But he was too \n",
      "late; for all the trails had grown old, or were washed away \n",
      "by the winter. Yet thus it was that passing southwards down \n",
      "Teiglin Turin came upon some of the Men of Brethil that \n",
      "were surrounded by Ores; and he delivered them, for the \n",
      "Ores fled from Gurthang. He named himself Wildman of the \n",
      "Woods, and they besought him to come and dwell with \n",
      "them; but he said that he had an errand yet unachieved, to \n",
      "seek Finduilas, Orodreth's daughter of Nargothrond. Then \n",
      "Dorlas, the leader of those woodmen, told the grievous \n",
      "tidings of her death. For the Men of Brethil had waylaid at \n",
      "the Crossings of Teiglin the Ore-host that led the captives \n",
      "of Nargothrond, hoping to rescue them; but the Ores had at \n",
      "once cruelly slain their prisoners, and Finduilas they pinned \n",
      "to a tree with a spear. So she died, saying at the last: 'Tell \n",
      "the Mormegil that Finduilas is here.' Therefore they had laid \n",
      "her in a mound near that place, and named it Haudh-en- \n",
      "Elleth, the Mound of the Elf-maid. \n",
      "\n",
      "Turin bade them lead him thither, and there he fell \n",
      "down into a darkness of grief that was near death. Then \n",
      "Dorlas by his black sword, the fame whereof had come \n",
      "even inter the deeps of Brethil, and by his quest of the \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "King's daughter, knew that this Wildman was indeed the \n",
      "Mormegil of Nargothrond, whom rumour said was the son \n",
      "of Hurin of Dor-lomin. Therefore the woodmen lifted him up, \n",
      "and bore him away to their homes. Now those were set in a \n",
      "stockade upon a high place in the forest, Ephel Brandir \n",
      "upon Amon Obel; for the People of Haleth were now \n",
      "dwindled by war, and Brandir son of Handir who ruled them \n",
      "was a man of gentle mood, and lame also from childhood, \n",
      "and he trusted rather in secrecy than in deeds of war to \n",
      "save them from the power of the North. Therefore he feared \n",
      "the tidings that Dorlas brought, and when he beheld the \n",
      "face of Turin as he lay on the bier a cloud of foreboding lay \n",
      "on his heart Nonetheless being moved by his woe he took \n",
      "him into his own house and tended him, for he had skill in \n",
      "healing. And with the beginning of spring Turin cast off his \n",
      "darkness, and grew hale again; and he arose, and he \n",
      "thought that he would remain in Brethil hidden, and put his \n",
      "shadow behind him, forsaking the past. He took therefore a \n",
      "new name, Turambar, which in the High-elven speech \n",
      "signified Master of Doom; and he besought the woodmen \n",
      "to forget that he was a stranger among them or ever bore \n",
      "any other name. Nonetheless he would not wholly leave \n",
      "deeds of war; for he could not endure that the Ores should \n",
      "come to the Crossings of Teiglin or draw nigh to Haudh-en- \n",
      "Elleth, and he made that a place of dread for them, so that \n",
      "they shunned it. But he laid his black sword by, and wielded \n",
      "rather the bow and the spear. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now new tidings came to Doriath concerning \n",
      "Nargothrond, for some that had escaped from the defeat \n",
      "and the sack, and had survived the Fell Winter in the wild, \n",
      "came at last to Thingol seeking refuge; and the march- \n",
      "wardens brought them to the King. And some said that all \n",
      "the enemy had withdrawn northwards, and others that \n",
      "Glaurung abode still in the halls of Felagund; and some \n",
      "said that the Mormegil was slain, and others that he was \n",
      "cast under a spell by the dragon and dwelt there yet, as one \n",
      "changed to stone. But all declared that it was known to \n",
      "many in Nargothrond ere the end that the Mormegil was \n",
      "none other than Turin son of Hurin of Dor-lomin. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Morwen was distraught, and refusing the counsel \n",
      "of Melian she rode forth alone into the wild to seek her son, \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "or some true tidings of him. Thingol therefore sent Mablung \n",
      "after her, with many hardy march-wards, to find her and \n",
      "guard her, and to learn what news they might; but Nienor \n",
      "was bidden to remain behind. Yet the fearlessness of her \n",
      "house was hers; and in an evil hour, in hope that Morwen \n",
      "would return when she saw that her daughter would go with \n",
      "her into peril, Nienor disguised herself as one of Thingol's \n",
      "people, and went with that ill-fated riding. \n",
      "\n",
      "They came upon Morwen by the banks of Sirion, and \n",
      "Mablung besought her to return to Menegroth; but she was \n",
      "fey, and would not be persuaded. Then also the coming of \n",
      "Nienor was revealed, and despite Morwen's command she \n",
      "would not go back; and Mablung perforce brought them to \n",
      "the hidden ferries at the Meres of Twilight, and they passed \n",
      "over Sirion. And after three days' journeying they came to \n",
      "Amon Ethir, the Hill of Spies, that long ago Felagund had \n",
      "caused to be raised with great labour, a league before the \n",
      "doors of Nargothrond. There Mablung set a guard of riders \n",
      "about Morwen and her daughter, and forbade them to go \n",
      "further. But he, seeing from the hill no sign of any enemy, \n",
      "went down with his scouts to the Narog, as stealthily as they \n",
      "could go. \n",
      "\n",
      "But Glaurung was aware of all that they did, and he \n",
      "came forth in heat of wrath, and lay into the river; and a vast \n",
      "vapour and foul reek went up, in which Mablung and his \n",
      "company were blinded and lost Then Glaurung passed east \n",
      "over Narog. \n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing the onset of the dragon the guards upon Amon \n",
      "Ethir sought to lead Morwen and Nienor away, and fly with \n",
      "them with all speed back eastwards; but the wind bore the \n",
      "blank mists upon them, and their horses were maddened \n",
      "by the dragon-stench, and were ungovernable, and ran this \n",
      "way and that, so that some were dashed against trees and \n",
      "were slain, and others were borne far away. Thus the ladies \n",
      "were lost, and of Morwen indeed no sure tidings came ever \n",
      "to Doriath after. But Nienor, being thrown by her steed, yet \n",
      "unhurt, made her way back to Amon Ethir, there to await \n",
      "Mablung, and came thus above the reek into the sunlight; \n",
      "and looking westward she stared straight into the eyes of \n",
      "Glaurung, whose head lay upon the hill-top. \n",
      "\n",
      "Her will strove with him for a while, but he put forth his \n",
      "power, and having learned who she was he constrained her \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "to gaze into his eyes, and he laid a spell of utter darkness \n",
      "and forgetfulness upon her, so that she could remember \n",
      "nothing that had ever befallen her, nor her own name, nor \n",
      "the name of any other thing; and for many days she could \n",
      "neither hear, nor see, nor stir by her own will. Then Glaurung \n",
      "left her standing alone upon Amon Ethir, and went back to \n",
      "Nargothrond. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now Mablung, who greatly daring had explored the \n",
      "halls of Felagund when Glaurung left them, fled from them at \n",
      "the approach of the dragon, and returned to Amon Ethir. \n",
      "The sun sank and night fell as he climbed the hill, and he \n",
      "found none there save Nienor, standing alone under the \n",
      "stars as an image of stone. No word she spoke or heard, \n",
      "but would follow, if he took up her hand. Therefore in great \n",
      "grief he led her away, though it seemed to him vain; for they \n",
      "were both like to perish, succourless in the wild. \n",
      "\n",
      "But they were found by three of Mablung's \n",
      "companions, and slowly they journeyed northward and \n",
      "eastward towards the fences of the land of Doriath beyond \n",
      "Sirion, and the guarded bridge nigh to the inflowing of \n",
      "Esgalduin. Slowly the strength of Nienor returned as they \n",
      "drew nearer to Doriath; but still she could not speak or \n",
      "hear, and walked blindly as she was led. But even as they \n",
      "drew near the fences at last she closed her staring eyes, \n",
      "and would sleep; and they laid her down, and rested also, \n",
      "unheedfully, for they were utterly outworn. There they were \n",
      "assailed by an Ore-band, such as now roamed often as \n",
      "nigh the fences of Doriath as they dared. But Nienor in that \n",
      "hour recovered hearing and sight, and being awakened by \n",
      "the cries of the Ores she sprang up in terror, and fled ere \n",
      "they could come to her. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Ores gave chase, and the Elves after; and \n",
      "they overtook the Ores and slew them ere they could harm \n",
      "her, but Nienor escaped them. For she fled as in a \n",
      "madness of fear, swifter than a deer, and tore off all her \n",
      "clothing as she ran, until she was naked; and she passed \n",
      "out of their sight, running northward, and though they sought \n",
      "her long they found her not, nor any trace of her. And at last \n",
      "Mablung in despair returned to Menegroth and told the \n",
      "tidings. Then Thingol and Melian were filled with grief; but \n",
      "Mablung went forth, and sought long in vain for tidings of \n",
      "Morwen and Nienor. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But Nienor ran on into the woods until she was spent, \n",
      "and then fell, and slept, and awoke; and it was a sunlit \n",
      "morning, and she rejoiced in light as it were a new thing, \n",
      "and all things else that she saw seemed new and strange, \n",
      "for she had no names for them. Nothing did she remember \n",
      "save a darkness that lay behind her, and a shadow of fear; \n",
      "therefore she went warily as a hunted beast, and became \n",
      "famished, for she had no food and knew not how to seek it \n",
      "But coming at last to the Crossings of Teiglin she passed \n",
      "over, seeking the shelter of the great trees of Brethil, for \n",
      "she was afraid, and it seemed to her that the darkness was \n",
      "overtaking her again from which she had fled. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But it was a great storm of thunder that came up from \n",
      "the south, and in terror she cast herself down upon the \n",
      "mound of Haudh-en-Elleth, stopping her ears from the \n",
      "thunder; but the rain smote her and drenched her, and she \n",
      "lay like a wild beast that is dying. There Turambar found \n",
      "her, as he came to the Crossings of Teiglin, having heard \n",
      "rumour of Ores that roamed near; and seeing in a flare of \n",
      "lightning the body as it seemed of a slain maiden lying \n",
      "upon the mound of Finduilas he was stricken to the heart. \n",
      "But the woodmen lifted her up, and Turambar cast his cloak \n",
      "about her, and they took her to a lodge nearby, and \n",
      "warmed her, and gave her food. And as soon as she \n",
      "looked upon Turambar she was comforted, for it seemed to \n",
      "her that she had found at last something that she had \n",
      "sought in her darkness; and she would not be parted from \n",
      "him. But when he asked her concerning her name and her \n",
      "kin and her misadventure, then she became troubled as a \n",
      "child that perceives that something is demanded but cannot \n",
      "understand what it may be; and she wept. Therefore \n",
      "Turambar said: 'Do not be troubled. The tale shall wait. But I \n",
      "will give you a name, and I will call you Niniel, Tear-maiden.' \n",
      "And at that name she shook her head, but said: Niniel. That \n",
      "was the first word she spoke after her darkness, and it \n",
      "remained her name among the woodmen ever after. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the next day they bore her towards Ephel Brandir; \n",
      "but when they came to Dimrost, the Rainy Stair, where the \n",
      "tumbling stream of Celebros fell towards Teiglin, a great \n",
      "shuddering came upon her, wherefore afterwards that \n",
      "place was called Nen Girith, the Shuddering Water. Ere \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "she came to the home of the woodmen upon Amon Obel \n",
      "she was sick of a fever; and long she lay thus, tended by \n",
      "the women of Brethil, and they taught her language as to an \n",
      "infant. But ere the autumn came by the skill of Brandir she \n",
      "was healed of her sickness, and she could speak; but \n",
      "nothing did she remember of the time before she was \n",
      "found by Turambar on the mound of Haudh-en-Elleth. And \n",
      "Brandir loved her; but all her heart was given to Turambar. \n",
      "\n",
      "In that time the woodmen were not troubled by the \n",
      "Ores, and Turambar went not to war, and there was peace \n",
      "in Brethil. His heart turned to Niniel, and he asked her in \n",
      "marriage; but for that time she delayed in spite of her love. \n",
      "For Brandir foreboded he knew not what, and sought to \n",
      "restrain her, rather for her sake than his own or rivalry with \n",
      "Turambar; and he revealed to her that Turambar was Turin \n",
      "son of Hurin, and though she knew not the name a shadow \n",
      "fell upon her mind. \n",
      "\n",
      "But when three years were passed since the sack of \n",
      "Nargothrond Turambar asked Niniel again, and vowed that \n",
      "now he would wed her, or else go back to war in the wild. \n",
      "And Niniel took him with joy, and they were wedded at the \n",
      "midsummer, and the woodmen of Brethil made a great \n",
      "feast. But ere the end of the year Glaurung sent Ores of his \n",
      "dominion against Brethil; and Turambar sat at home \n",
      "deedless, for he had promised to Niniel that he would go to \n",
      "battle only if their homes were assailed. But the woodmen \n",
      "were worsted, and Dorlas upbraided him that he would not \n",
      "aid the people that he had taken for his own. Then \n",
      "Turambar arose and brought forth again his black sword, \n",
      "and he gathered a great company of the Men of Brethil, and \n",
      "they defeated the Ores utterly. But Glaurung heard tidings \n",
      "that the Black Sword was in Brethil, and he pondered what \n",
      "he heard, devising new evil. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the spring of the year after Niniel conceived, and she \n",
      "became wan and sad; and at the same time there came to \n",
      "Ephel Brandir the first rumours that Glaurung had issued \n",
      "from Nargothrond. Then Turambar sent out scouts far \n",
      "afield, for now he ordered things as he would, and few gave \n",
      "heed to Brandir. As it drew near to summer Glaurung came \n",
      "to the borders of Brethil, and lay near the west shores of \n",
      "Teiglin; and then there was great fear among the woodfolk, \n",
      "for it was now plain that the Great Worm would assail them \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "and ravage their land, and not pass by, returning to \n",
      "Angband, as they had hoped. They sought therefore the \n",
      "counsel of Turambar; and he counselled them that it was \n",
      "vain to go against Glaurung with all their force, for only by \n",
      "cunning and good fortune could they defeat him. He offered \n",
      "therefore himself to seek the dragon on the borders of the \n",
      "land, and bade the rest of the people to remain at Ephel \n",
      "Brandir, but to prepare for flight. For if Glaurung had the \n",
      "victory, he would come first to the woodmen's homes to \n",
      "destroy them, and they could not hope to withstand him; but \n",
      "if they then scattered far and wide, then many might \n",
      "escape, for Glaurung would not take up his dwelling in \n",
      "Brethil, and would return soon to Nargothrond. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Turambar asked for companions willing to aid \n",
      "him in his peril; and Dorlas stood forth, but no others. \n",
      "Therefore Dorlas upbraided the people, and spoke scorn \n",
      "of Brandir, who could not play the part of the heir of the \n",
      "house of Haleth; and Brandir was shamed before his \n",
      "people, and was bitter at heart. But Hunthor, kinsman of \n",
      "Brandir, asked his leave to go in his stead. Then Turambar \n",
      "said farewell to Niniel, and she was filled with fear and \n",
      "foreboding, and their parting was sorrowful; but Turambar \n",
      "set out with his two companions and went to Nen Girith. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Niniel being unable to endure her fear, and \n",
      "unwilling to wait in the Ephel tidings of Turambar's fortune, \n",
      "set forth after him, and a great company went with her. At \n",
      "this Brandir was filled all the more with dread, and he \n",
      "sought to dissuade her and the people that would go with \n",
      "her from this rashness, but they heeded him not. Therefore \n",
      "he renounced his lordship, and all love for the people that \n",
      "had scorned him, and having naught left but his love for \n",
      "Niniel he girt himself with a sword and went after her; but \n",
      "being lame he fell far behind. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now Turambar came to Nen Girith at sundown, and \n",
      "there he learned that Glaurung lay on the brink of the high \n",
      "shores of Teiglin, and was like to move when night fell. \n",
      "Then he called those tidings good; for the dragon lay at \n",
      "Cabed-en-Aras, where the river ran in a deep and narrow \n",
      "gorge that a hunted deer might overleap, and Turambar \n",
      "thought that he would seek no further, but would attempt to \n",
      "pass over the gorge. Therefore he purposed to creep down \n",
      "at dusk, and descend into the ravine under night, and cross \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "over the wild water; and then to climb up the further cliff, and \n",
      "so come to the dragon beneath his guard. \n",
      "\n",
      "This counsel he took, but the heart of Dorlas failed \n",
      "when they came to the races of Teiglin in the dark, and he \n",
      "dared not attempt the perilous crossing, but drew back and \n",
      "lurked in the woods, burdened with shame. Turambar and \n",
      "Hunthor, nonetheless, crossed over in safety, for the loud \n",
      "roaring of the water drowned all other sounds, and \n",
      "Glaurung slept. But ere the middle-night the dragon roused, \n",
      "and with a great noise and blast cast his forward part \n",
      "across the chasm, and began to draw his bulk after. \n",
      "Turambar and Hunthor were well-nigh overcome by the heat \n",
      "and the stench, as they sought in haste for a way up to \n",
      "come at Glaurung; and Hunthor was slain by a great stone \n",
      "that was dislodged from on high by the passage of the \n",
      "dragon, and smote him on the head and cast him into the \n",
      "river. So he ended, of the house of Haleth not the least \n",
      "valiant \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Turambar summoned all his will and courage and \n",
      "climbed the cliff alone, and came beneath the dragon. Then \n",
      "he drew Gurthang, and with all the might of his arm, and of \n",
      "his hate, he thrust it into the soft belly of the Worm, even up \n",
      "to the hilts. But when Glaurung felt his death-pang, he \n",
      "screamed, and in his dreadful throe he heaved up his bulk \n",
      "and hurled himself across the chasm, and there lay lashing \n",
      "and coiling in his agony. And he set all in a blaze about him, \n",
      "and beat all to ruin, until at last his fires died, and he lay still. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now Gurthang had been wrested from Turambar's \n",
      "hand in the throe of Glaurung, and it clave to the belly of the \n",
      "dragon. Turambar therefore crossed the water once more, \n",
      "desiring to recover his sword and to look upon his foe; and \n",
      "he found him stretched at his length, and rolled upon one \n",
      "side, and the hilts of Gurthang stood in his belly. Then \n",
      "Turambar seized the hilts and set his foot upon the belly, \n",
      "and cried in mockery of the dragon and his words at \n",
      "Nargothrond: 'Hail, Worm of Morgoth! Well met again! Die \n",
      "now and the darkness have thee! Thus is Turin son of Hurin \n",
      "avenged.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then he wrenched out the sword, but a spout of black \n",
      "blood followed it, and fell on his hand, and the venom \n",
      "burned it. And thereupon Glaurung opened his eyes and \n",
      "looked upon Turambar with such malice that it smote him \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "as a blow; and by that stroke and the anguish of the venom \n",
      "he fell into a dark swoon, and lay as one dead, and his \n",
      "sword was beneath him. \n",
      "\n",
      "The screams of Glaurung rang in the woods, and came \n",
      "to the people that waited at Nen Girith; and when those that \n",
      "looked forth heard them, and saw afar the ruin and burning \n",
      "that the dragon made, they deemed that he had triumphed \n",
      "and was destroying those that assailed him. And Niniel sat \n",
      "and shuddered beside the falling water, and at the voice of \n",
      "Glaurung her darkness crept upon her again, so that she \n",
      "could not stir from that place of her own will. \n",
      "\n",
      "Even so Brandir found her, for he came to Nen Girith at \n",
      "last, limping wearily; and when he heard that the dragon \n",
      "had crossed the river and had beaten down his foes, his \n",
      "heart yearned towards Niniel in pity. Yet he thought also: \n",
      "'Turambar is dead, but Niniel lives. Now it may be that she \n",
      "will come with me, and I will lead her away, and so we shall \n",
      "escape from the dragon together.' After a while therefore \n",
      "he stood by Niniel, and he said: 'Come! It is time to go. If \n",
      "you will, I will lead you.' And he took her hand, and she \n",
      "arose silently, and followed him; and in the darkness none \n",
      "saw them go. \n",
      "\n",
      "But as they went down the path to the Crossings the \n",
      "moon rose, and cast a grey light on the land, and Niniel \n",
      "said: 'Is this the way?' And Brandir answered that he knew \n",
      "no way, save to flee as they might from Glaurung, and \n",
      "escape into the wild. But Niniel said: 'The Black Sword was \n",
      "my beloved and my husband. To seek him only do I go. \n",
      "What else could you think?' And she sped on before him. \n",
      "Thus she came towards the Crossings of Teiglin and \n",
      "beheld Haudh-en-Elleth in the white moonlight, and great \n",
      "dread came on her. Then with a cry she turned away, \n",
      "casting off her cloak, and fled southward along the river, \n",
      "and her white raiment shone in the moon. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus Brandir saw her from the hill-side, and turned to \n",
      "cross her path, but he was still behind her when she came \n",
      "to the ruin of Glaurung nigh the brink of Cabed-en-Aras. \n",
      "There she saw the dragon lying, but she heeded him not, \n",
      "for a man lay beside him; and she ran to Turambar, and \n",
      "called his name in vain. Then finding that his hand was \n",
      "burned she washed it with tears and bound it about with a \n",
      "strip of her raiment, and she kissed him and cried on him \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "again to awake. Thereat Glaurung stirred for the last time \n",
      "ere he died, and he spoke with his last breath, saying: 'Hail, \n",
      "Nienor, daughter of Hurin. We meet again ere the end. I \n",
      "give thee joy that thou hast found thy brother at last. And \n",
      "now thou shalt know him: a stabber in the dark, treacherous \n",
      "to foes, faithless to friends, and a curse unto his kin, Turin \n",
      "son of Hurin! But the worst of all his deeds thou shalt feel in \n",
      "thyself.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Glaurung died, and the veil of his malice was \n",
      "taken from her, and she remembered all the days of her life. \n",
      "Looking down upon Turin she cried: 'Farewell, O twice \n",
      "beloved! A Turin Turambar turun ambartanen: master of \n",
      "doom by doom mastered! O happy to be dead!' Then \n",
      "Brandir who had heard all, standing stricken upon the edge \n",
      "of ruin, hastened towards her; but she ran from him \n",
      "distraught with horror and anguish, and coming to the brink \n",
      "of Cabed-en-Aras she cast herself over, and was lost in the \n",
      "wild water. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Brandir came and looked down, and turned away \n",
      "in horror; and though he no longer desired life, he could not \n",
      "seek death in that roaring water. And thereafter no man \n",
      "looked again upon Cabed-en-Aras, nor would any beast or \n",
      "bird come there, nor any tree grow; and it was named \n",
      "Cabed Naeramarth, the Leap of Dreadful Doom. \n",
      "\n",
      "But Brandir made his way back to Nen Girith, to bring \n",
      "tidings to the people; and he met Dorlas in the woods, and \n",
      "slew him: the first blood that ever he had spilled, and the \n",
      "last. And he came to Nen Girith, and men cried to him: \n",
      "'Have you seen her? For Niniel is gone.' \n",
      "\n",
      "And he answered: 'Niniel is gone for ever. The Dragon \n",
      "is dead, and Turambar is dead; and those tidings are \n",
      "good.' The people murmured at these words, saying that he \n",
      "was crazed; but Brandir said: 'Hear me to the end! Niniel \n",
      "the beloved is also dead. She cast herself into Teiglin, \n",
      "desiring life no more; for she learned that she was none \n",
      "other than Nienor daughter of Hurin of Dor-lomin, ere her \n",
      "forgetfulness came upon her, and that Turambar was her \n",
      "brother, Turin son of Hurin. ' \n",
      "\n",
      "But even as he ceased, and the people wept, Turin \n",
      "himself came before them. For when the dragon died, his \n",
      "swoon left him, and he fell into a deep sleep of weariness. \n",
      "But the cold of the night troubled him, and the hilts of \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Gurthang drove into his side, and he awoke. Then he saw \n",
      "that one had tended his hand, and he wondered much that \n",
      "he was left nonetheless to lie upon the cold ground; and he \n",
      "called, and hearing no answer he went in search of aid, for \n",
      "he was weary and sick. \n",
      "\n",
      "But when the people saw him they drew back in fear, \n",
      "thinking that it was his unquiet spirit; and he said: 'Nay, be \n",
      "glad; for the Dragon is dead, and I live. But wherefore have \n",
      "you scorned my counsel, and come into peril? And where is \n",
      "Niniel? For her I would see. And surely you did not bring her \n",
      "from her home?' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Brandir told him that it was so, and Niniel was \n",
      "dead. But the wife of Dorlas cried out: 'Nay, lord, he is \n",
      "crazed. For he came here saying that you were dead, and \n",
      "he called it good tidings. But you live.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Turambar was wrathful, and believed that all \n",
      "Brandir said or did was done in malice towards himself and \n",
      "Niniel, begrudging their love; and he spoke evilly to Brandir, \n",
      "calling him Club-foot. Then Brandir reported all that he had \n",
      "heard, and named Niniel Nienor daughter of Hurin, and he \n",
      "cried out upon Turambar with the last words of Glaurung, \n",
      "that he was a curse unto his kin and to all that harboured \n",
      "him. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Turambar fell into a fury, for in those words he \n",
      "heard the feet of his doom overtaking him; and he charged \n",
      "Brandir with leading Niniel to her death, and publishing with \n",
      "delight the lies of Glaurung, if indeed be devised them not \n",
      "himself. Then he cursed Brandir, and slew him; and he fled \n",
      "from the people into the woods. But after a while his \n",
      "madness left him, and he came to Haudh-en-Elleth, and \n",
      "there sat, and pondered all his deeds. And he cried upon \n",
      "Finduilas to bring him counsel; for he knew not whether he \n",
      "would do now more ill to go to Doriath to seek his kin, or to \n",
      "forsake them for ever and seek death in battle. \n",
      "\n",
      "And even as he sat there Mablung with a company of \n",
      "Grey-elves came over the Crossings of Teiglin, and he \n",
      "knew Turin, and hailed him, and was glad indeed to find \n",
      "him yet living; for he had learned of the coming forth of \n",
      "Glaurung and that his path led to Brethil, and also he had \n",
      "heard report that the Black Sword of Nargothrond now \n",
      "dwelt there. Therefore he came to give warning to Turin, \n",
      "and help if need be; but Turin said: 'You come too late. The \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Dragon is dead.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then they marvelled, and gave him great praise; but he \n",
      "cared nothing for it, and said: This only I ask: give me news \n",
      "of my kin, for in Dor-lomin I learned that they had gone to \n",
      "the Hidden Kingdom.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Mablung was dismayed, but needs must tell to \n",
      "Turin how Morwen was lost, and Nienor cast into a spell of \n",
      "dumb forgetfulness, and how she escaped them upon the \n",
      "borders of Doriath and fled northwards. Then at last Turin \n",
      "knew that doom had overtaken him, and that he had slain \n",
      "Brandir unjustly; so that the words of Glaurung were fulfilled \n",
      "in him. And he laughed as one fey, crying: This is a bitter \n",
      "jest indeed!' But he bade Mablung go, and return to \n",
      "Doriath, with curses upon it. 'And a curse too upon your \n",
      "errand!' he cried. 'This only was wanting. Now comes the \n",
      "night.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then he fled from them like the wind, and they were \n",
      "amazed, wondering what madness had seized him; and \n",
      "they followed after him. But Turin far out-ran them; and he \n",
      "came to Cabed-en-Aras, and heard the roaring of the \n",
      "water, and saw that all the leaves fell sere from the trees, as \n",
      "though winter had come. There he drew forth his sword, that \n",
      "now alone remained to him of all his possessions, and he \n",
      "said: 'Hail Gurthang! No lord or loyalty dost thou know, save \n",
      "the hand that wieldeth thee. From no blood wilt thou shrink. \n",
      "Wilt thou therefore take Turin Turambar, wilt thou slay me \n",
      "swiftly?' \n",
      "\n",
      "And from the blade rang a cold voice in answer: 'Yea, I \n",
      "will drink thy blood gladly, that so I may forget the blood of \n",
      "Beleg my master, and the blood of Brandir slain unjustly. I \n",
      "will slay thee swiftly.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Turin set the hilts upon the ground, and cast \n",
      "himself upon the point of Gurthang, and the black blade \n",
      "took his life. But Mablung and the Elves came and looked \n",
      "on the shape of Glaurung lying dead, and upon the body of \n",
      "Turin, and they grieved; and when Men of Brethil came \n",
      "thither, and they learned the reasons of Turin's madness \n",
      "and death, they were aghast; and Mablung said bitterly: 'I \n",
      "also have been meshed in the doom of the Children of \n",
      "Hurin, and thus with my tidings have slain one that I loved.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then they lifted up Turin, and found that Gurthang had \n",
      "broken asunder. But Elves and Men gathered there great \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "store of wood, and they made a mighty burning, and the \n",
      "Dragon was consumed to ashes. Turin they laid in a high \n",
      "mound where he had fallen, and the shards of Gurthang \n",
      "were laid beside him. And when all was done, the Elves \n",
      "sang a lament for the Children of Hurin, and a great grey \n",
      "stone was set upon the mound, and thereon was carven in \n",
      "runes of Doriath: \n",
      "\n",
      "TURIN TURAMBAR DAGNIR GLAURUNGA \n",

      "Chapter 22 \n",
      "\n",
      "Of the Ruin of Doriath \n",
      "\n",
      "So ended the tale of Turin Turambar; but Morgoth did \n",
      "not sleep nor rest from evil, and his dealings with the house \n",
      "of Hador were not yet ended. Against them his malice was \n",
      "unsated, though Hurin was under his eye, and Morwen \n",
      "wandered distraught in the wild. \n",
      "\n",
      "Unhappy was the lot of Hurin; for all that Morgoth knew \n",
      "of the working of his malice Hurin knew also, but lies were \n",
      "mingled with the truth, and aught that was good was hidden \n",
      "or distorted. In all ways Morgoth sought most to cast an evil \n",
      "light on those things that Thingol and Melian had done, for \n",
      "he hated them, and feared them. When therefore he judged \n",
      "the time to be ripe, he released Hurin from his bondage, \n",
      "bidding him go whither he would; and he feigned that in this \n",
      "he was moved by pity as for an enemy utterly defeated. But \n",
      "he lied, for his purpose was that Hurin should still further his \n",
      "hatred for Elves and Men, ere he died. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then little though he trusted the words of Morgoth, \n",
      "knowing indeed that he was without pity, Hurin took his \n",
      "freedom, and went forth in grief, embittered by the words of \n",
      "the Dark Lord; and a year was now gone since the death of \n",
      "Turin his son. For twenty-eight years he had been captive in \n",
      "Angband, and he was grown grim to look upon. His hair \n",
      "and beard were white and long, but he walked unbowed, \n",
      "bearing a great black staff; and he was girt with a sword. \n",
      "Thus he passed into Hithlum, and tidings came to the \n",
      "chieftains of the Easterlings that there was a great riding of \n",
      "captains and black soldiers of Angband over the sands of \n",
      "Anfauglith, and with them came an old man, as one that \n",
      "was held in high honour. Therefore they did not lay hands \n",
      "on Hurin, but let him walk at will in those lands; in which they \n",
      "were wise, for the remnant of his own people shunned him, \n",
      "because of his coming from Angband as one in league and \n",
      "honour with Morgoth. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus his freedom did but increase the bitterness of \n",
      "Hurin's heart; and he departed from the land of Hithlum and \n",
      "went up into the mountains. Thence he descried far off. \n",
      "amid the clouds the peaks of the Crissaegrim, and he \n",
      "remembered Turgon; and he desired to come again to the \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hidden realm of Gondolin. He went down therefore from \n",
      "Ered Wethrin, and he knew not that the creatures of \n",
      "Morgoth watched all his steps; and crossing over the \n",
      "Brithiach he passed into Dimbar, and came to the dark feet \n",
      "of the Echoriath. All the land was cold and desolate, and he \n",
      "looked about him with little hope, standing at the foot of a \n",
      "great fall of stones beneath a sheer rock-wall; and he knew \n",
      "not that this was all that was now left to see of the old Way \n",
      "of Escape: the Dry River was blocked, and the arched gate \n",
      "was buried. Then Hurin looked up to the grey sky, thinking \n",
      "that he might once more descry the eagles, as he had done \n",
      "long ago in his youth; but he saw only the shadows blown \n",
      "from the east, and clouds swirling about the inaccessible \n",
      "peaks, and he heard only the wind hissing over the stones. \n",
      "\n",
      "But the watch of the great eagles was now redoubled, \n",
      "and they marked Hurin well, far below, forlorn in the fading \n",
      "light; and straightway Thorondor himself, since the tidings \n",
      "seemed great, brought word to Turgon. But Turgon said: \n",
      "'Does Morgoth sleep? You were mistaken.' \n",
      "\n",
      "'Not so,' said Thorondor. 'If the Eagles of Manwe were \n",
      "wont to err thus, then long ago, lord, your hiding would have \n",
      "been in vain.' \n",
      "\n",
      "'Then your words bode ill,' said Turgon; 'for they can \n",
      "bear but one meaning. Even Hurin Thalion has surrendered \n",
      "to the will of Morgoth. My heart is shut.' \n",
      "\n",
      "But when Thorondor was gone, Turgon sat long in \n",
      "thought, and he was troubled, remembering the deeds of \n",
      "Hurin of Dor-lomin; and he opened his heart, and sent to \n",
      "the eagles to seek for Hurin, and to bring him if they might \n",
      "to Gondolin. But it was too late, and they never saw him \n",
      "again in light or in shadow. \n",
      "\n",
      "For Hurin stood in despair before the silent cliffs of the \n",
      "Echoriath, and the westering sun, piercing the clouds, \n",
      "stained his white hair with red. Then he cried aloud in the \n",
      "wilderness, heedless of any ears, and he cursed the \n",
      "pitiless land; and standing at last upon a high rock he \n",
      "looked towards Gondolin and called in a great voice: \n",
      "'Turgon, Turgon, remember the Fen of Serech! O Turgon, \n",
      "will you not hear in your hidden halls?' But there was no \n",
      "sound save the wind in the dry grasses. 'Even so they \n",
      "hissed in Serech at the sunset,' he said; and as he spoke \n",
      "the sun went behind the Mountains of Shadow, and a \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "darkness fell about him, and the wind ceased, and there \n",
      "was silence in the waste. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yet there were ears that heard the words that Hurin \n",
      "spoke, and report of all came soon to the Dark Throne in \n",
      "the north; and Morgoth smiled, for he knew now clearly in \n",
      "what region Turgon dwelt, though because of the eagles no \n",
      "spy of his could yet come within sight of the land behind the \n",
      "Encircling Mountains. This was the first evil that the \n",
      "freedom of Hurin achieved. \n",
      "\n",
      "As darkness fell Hurin stumbled from the rock, and fell \n",
      "into a heavy sleep of grief. But in his sleep he heard the \n",
      "voice of Morwen lamenting, and often she spoke his name; \n",
      "and it seemed to him that her voice came out of Brethil. \n",
      "Therefore when he awoke with the coming of day he arose, \n",
      "and went back to the Brithiach; and passing along the \n",
      "eaves of Brethil he came at a time of night to the Crossings \n",
      "of Teiglin. The night-sentinels saw him, but they were filled \n",
      "with dread, for they thought that they saw a ghost out of \n",
      "some ancient battle-mound that walked with darkness \n",
      "about it; and therefore Hurin was not stayed, and he came \n",
      "at last to the place of the burning of Glaurung, and saw the \n",
      "tall stone standing near the brink of Cabed Naeramarth. \n",
      "\n",
      "But Hurin did not look at the stone, for he knew what \n",
      "was written there; and his eyes had seen that he was not \n",
      "alone. Sitting in the shadow of the stone there was a \n",
      "woman, bent over her knees; and as Hurin stood there \n",
      "silent she cast back her tattered hood and lifted her face. \n",
      "Grey she was and old, but suddenly her eyes looked into \n",
      "his, and he knew her; for though they were wild and full of \n",
      "fear, that light still gleamed in them that long ago had \n",
      "earned for her the name Eledhwen, proudest and most \n",
      "beautiful of mortal women in the days of old. \n",
      "\n",
      "'You come at last,' she said. 'I have waited too long.' \n",
      "\n",
      "'It was a dark road. I have come as I could,' he \n",
      "answered. \n",
      "\n",
      "'But you are too late,' said Morwen. 'They are lost.' \n",
      "\n",
      "'I know it,' he said. 'But you are not.' \n",
      "\n",
      "But Morwen said: 'Almost. I am spent I shall go with the \n",
      "sun. Now little time is left: if you know, tell me! How did she \n",
      "find him?' \n",
      "\n",
      "But Hurin did not answer, and they sat beside the \n",
      "stone, and did not speak again; and when the sun went \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "down Morwen sighed and clasped his hand, and was still; \n",
      "and Hurin knew that she had died. He looked down at her in \n",
      "the twilight and it seemed to him that the lines of grief and \n",
      "cruel hardship were smoothed away. 'She was not \n",
      "conquered,' he said; and he closed her eyes, and sat \n",
      "unmoving beside her as the night drew down. The waters of \n",
      "Cabed Naeramarth roared on, but he heard no sound, and \n",
      "he saw nothing, and felt nothing, for his heart was stone \n",
      "within him. But there came a chill wind that drove sharp rain \n",
      "into his face; and he was roused, and anger rose in him like \n",
      "smoke, mastering reason, so that all his desire was to seek \n",
      "vengeance for his wrongs and for the wrongs of his kin, \n",
      "accusing in his anguish all those who ever had dealings \n",
      "with them. Then he rose up, and he made a grave for \n",
      "Morwen above Cabed Naeramarth on the west side of the \n",
      "stone; and upon it he cut these words: Here lies also \n",
      "Momen Eledhwen. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It is told that a seer and harp-player of Brethil named \n",
      "Glirhuin made a song, saying that the Stone of the Hapless \n",
      "should not be defiled by Morgoth nor ever thrown down, not \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "though the sea should drown all the land; as after indeed \n",
      "befell, and still Tol Morwen stands alone in the water \n",
      "beyond the new coasts that were made in the days of the \n",
      "wrath of the Valar. But Hurin does not lie there, for his doom \n",
      "drove him on, and the Shadow still followed him. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now Hurin crossed over Teiglin and passed \n",
      "southwards down the ancient road that led to Nargothrond; \n",
      "and he saw far off to the eastward the lonely height of Amon \n",
      "Rudh, and knew what had befallen there. At length he came \n",
      "to the banks of Narog, and ventured the passage of the wild \n",
      "river upon the fallen stones of the bridge, as Mablung of \n",
      "Doriath had ventured it before him; and he stood before the \n",
      "broken Doors of Felagund, leaning upon his staff. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here it must be told that after the departure of \n",
      "Glaurung MTm the Petty-Dwarf had found his way to \n",
      "Nargothrond, and crept within the ruined halls; and he took \n",
      "possession of them, and sat there fingering the gold and \n",
      "the gems, letting them run ever through his hands, for none \n",
      "came nigh to despoil him, from dread of the spirit of \n",
      "Glaurung and his very memory. But now one had come, and \n",
      "stood upon the threshold; and MTm came forth, and \n",
      "demanded to know his purpose. But Hurin said: 'Who are \n",
      "you, that would hinder me from entering the house of Finrod \n",
      "Felagund?' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Dwarf answered: 'I am MTm; and before the \n",
      "proud ones came from over the Sea, Dwarves delved the \n",
      "halls of NulukkizdTn. I have but returned to take what is mine; \n",
      "for I am the last of my people.' \n",
      "\n",
      "'Then you shall enjoy your inheritance no longer,' said \n",
      "Hurin; 'for I am Hurin son of Galdor, returned out of \n",
      "Angband, and my son was Turin Turambar, whom you have \n",
      "not forgotten; and he it was that slew Glaurung the Dragon, \n",
      "who wasted these halls where now you sit; and not unknown \n",
      "is it to me by whom the Dragon-helm of Dor-lomin was \n",
      "betrayed.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then MTm in great fear besought Hurin to take what he \n",
      "would, but to spare his life; but Hurin gave no heed to his \n",
      "prayer, and slew him there before the doors of \n",
      "Nargothrond. Then he entered in, and stayed a while in that \n",
      "dreadful place, where the treasures of Valinor lay strewn \n",
      "upon the floors in darkness and decay; but it is told that \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "when Hurin came forth from the wreck of Nargothrond and \n",
      "stood again beneath the sky he bore with him out of all that \n",
      "great hoard but one thing only. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now Hurin journeyed eastward, and he came to the \n",
      "Meres of Twilight above the Falls of Sirion; and there he \n",
      "was taken by the Elves that guarded the western marches \n",
      "of Doriath, and brought before King Thingol in the \n",
      "Thousand Caves. Then Thingol was filled with wonder and \n",
      "grief when he looked on him, and knew that grim and aged \n",
      "man for Hurin Thalion, the captive of Morgoth; but he \n",
      "greeted him fairly and showed him honour. Hurin made no \n",
      "answer to the King, but drew forth from beneath his cloak \n",
      "that one thing which he had taken with him out of \n",
      "Nargothrond; and that was no lesser treasure than the \n",
      "Nauglamir, the Necklace of the Dwarves, that was made for \n",
      "Finrod Felagund long years before by the craftsmen of \n",
      "Nogrod and Belegost, most famed of all their works in the \n",
      "Elder Days, and prized by Finrod while he lived above all \n",
      "the treasures of Nargothrond. And Hurin cast it at the feet of \n",
      "Thingol with wild and bitter words. \n",
      "\n",
      "'Receive thou thy fee,' he cried, 'for thy fair keeping of \n",
      "my children and my wife! For this is the Nauglamir, whose \n",
      "name is known to many among Elves and Men; and I bring \n",
      "it to thee out of the darkness of Nargothrond, where Finrod \n",
      "thy kinsman left it behind him when he set forth with Beren \n",
      "son of Barahir to fulfil the errand of Thingol of Doriath!' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Thingol looked upon the great treasure, and \n",
      "knew it for the Nauglamir, and well did he understand \n",
      "Hurin's intent; but being filled with pity he restrained his \n",
      "wrath, and endured Hurin's scorn. And at the last Melian \n",
      "spoke, and said: 'Hurin Thalion, Morgoth hath bewitched \n",
      "thee; for he that seeth through Morgoth's eyes, willing or \n",
      "unwilling, seeth all things crooked. Long was Turin thy son \n",
      "fostered in the halls of Menegroth, and shown love and \n",
      "honour as the son of the King; and it was not by the King's \n",
      "will nor by mine that he came never back to Doriath. And \n",
      "afterwards thy wife and thy daughter were harboured here \n",
      "with honour and goodwill; and we sought by all means that \n",
      "we might to dissuade Morwen from the road to \n",
      "Nargothrond. With the voice of Morgoth thou dost now \n",
      "upbraid thy friends.' \n",
      "\n",
      "And hearing the words of Melian Hurin stood \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "moveless, and he gazed long into the eyes of the Queen; \n",
      "and there in Menegroth, defended still by the Girdle of \n",
      "Melian from the darkness of the Enemy, he read the truth of \n",
      "all that was done, and tasted at last the fullness of woe that \n",
      "was measured for him by Morgoth Bauglir. And he spoke \n",
      "no more of what was past, but stooping lifted up the \n",
      "Nauglamir from where it lay before Thingol's chair, and he \n",
      "gave it to him, saying: 'Receive now, lord, the Necklace of \n",
      "the Dwarves, as a gift from one who has nothing, and as a \n",
      "memorial of Hurin of Dor-lomin. For now my fate is fulfilled, \n",
      "and the purpose of Morgoth achieved; but I am his thrall no \n",
      "longer.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then he turned away, and passed out from the \n",
      "Thousand Caves, and all that saw him fell back before his \n",
      "face; and none sought to withstand his going, nor did any \n",
      "know whither he went. But it is said that Hurin would not live \n",
      "thereafter, being bereft of all purpose and desire, and cast \n",
      "himself at last into the western sea; and so ended the \n",
      "mightiest of the warriors of mortal Men. \n",
      "\n",
      "But when Hurin was gone from Menegroth, Thingol sat \n",
      "long in silence, gazing upon the great treasure that lay upon \n",
      "his knees; and it came into his mind that it should be \n",
      "remade, and in it should be set the Silmaril. For as the \n",
      "years passed Thingol's thought turned unceasingly to the \n",
      "jewel of Feanor, and became bound to it, and he liked not \n",
      "to let it rest even behind the doors of his inmost treasury; \n",
      "and he was minded now to bear it with him always, waking \n",
      "and sleeping. \n",
      "\n",
      "In those days the Dwarves still came on their journeys \n",
      "into Beleriand from their mansions in Ered Lindon, and \n",
      "passing over Gelion at Sam Athrad, the Ford of Stones, \n",
      "they travelled the ancient road to Doriath; for their skill in the \n",
      "working of metal and stone was very great, and there was \n",
      "much need of their craft in the halls of Menegroth. But they \n",
      "came now no longer in small parties as aforetime, but in \n",
      "great companies well armed for their protection in the \n",
      "perilous lands between Aros and Gelion; and they dwelt in \n",
      "Menegroth at such times in chambers and smithies set \n",
      "apart for them. At that very time great craftsmen of Nogrod \n",
      "were lately come into Doriath; and the King therefore \n",
      "summoning them declared his desire, that if their skill were \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "great enough they should remake the Nauglamir, and in it \n",
      "set the Silmaril. Then the Dwarves looked upon the work of \n",
      "their fathers, and they beheld with wonder the shining jewel \n",
      "of Feanor; and they were filled with a great lust to possess \n",
      "them, and carry them off to their far homes in the \n",
      "mountains. But they dissembled their mind, and consented \n",
      "to the task. \n",
      "\n",
      "Long was their labour; and Thingol went down alone to \n",
      "their deep smithies, and sat ever among them as they \n",
      "worked. In time his desire was achieved, and the greatest \n",
      "of the works of Elves and Dwarves were brought together \n",
      "and made one; and its beauty was very great, for now the \n",
      "countless jewels of the Nauglamir did reflect and cast \n",
      "abroad in marvellous hues the light of the Silmaril \n",
      "amidmost. Then Thingol, being alone among them, made \n",
      "to take it up and clasp it about his neck; but the Dwarves in \n",
      "that moment withheld it from him, and demanded that he \n",
      "yield it up to them, saying: 'By what right does the Elvenking \n",
      "lay claim to the Nauglamir, that was made by our fathers for \n",
      "Finrod Felagund who is dead? It has come to him but by \n",
      "the hand of Hurin the Man of Dor-lomin, who took it as a \n",
      "thief out of the darkness of Nargothrond.' But Thingol \n",
      "perceived their hearts, and saw well that desiring the \n",
      "Silmaril they sought but a pretext and fair cloak for their true \n",
      "intent; and in his wrath and pride he gave no heed to his \n",
      "peril, but spoke to them in scorn, saying: 'How do ye of \n",
      "uncouth race dare to demand aught of me, Elu Thingol, \n",
      "Lord of Beleriand, whose life began by the waters of \n",
      "Cuivienen years uncounted ere the fathers of the stunted \n",
      "people awoke?' And standing tall and proud among them \n",
      "he bade them with shameful words be gone unrequited out \n",
      "of Doriath. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the lust of the Dwarves was kindled to rage by \n",
      "the words of the King; and they rose up about him, and laid \n",
      "hands on him, and slew him as he stood. So died in the \n",
      "deep places of Menegroth Elwe Singollo, King of Doriath, \n",
      "who alone of all the Children of lluvatar was joined with one \n",
      "of the Ainur; and he who, alone of the Forsaken Elves, had \n",
      "seen the light of the Trees of Valinor, with his last sight \n",
      "gazed upon the Silmaril. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Dwarves taking the Nauglamir passed out of \n",
      "Menegroth and fled eastwards through Region. But tidings \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "went swiftly through the forest, and few of that company \n",
      "came over Aros, for they were pursued to the death as they \n",
      "sought the eastward road; and the Nauglamir was retaken, \n",
      "and brought back in bitter grief to Melian the Queen. Yet \n",
      "two there were of the slayers of Thingol who escaped from \n",
      "the pursuit on the eastern marches, and returned at last to \n",
      "their city far off in the Blue Mountains; and there in Nogrod \n",
      "they told somewhat of all that had befallen, saying that the \n",
      "Dwarves were slain in Doriath by command of the \n",
      "Elvenking, who thus would cheat them of their reward. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then great was the wrath and lamentation of the \n",
      "Dwarves of Nogrod for the death of their kin and their great \n",
      "craftsmen, and they tore their beards, and wailed; and long \n",
      "they sat taking thought for vengeance. It is told that they \n",
      "asked aid from Belegost, but it was denied them, and the \n",
      "Dwarves of Belegost sought to dissuade them from their \n",
      "purpose; but their counsel was unavailing, and ere long a \n",
      "great host came forth from Nogrod, and crossing over \n",
      "Gelion marched westward through Beleriand. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Upon Doriath a heavy change had fallen. Melian sat \n",
      "long in silence beside Thingol the King, and her thought \n",
      "passed back into the starlit years and to their first meeting \n",
      "among the nightingales of Nan Elmoth in ages past; and \n",
      "she knew that her parting from Thingol was the forerunner \n",
      "of a greater parting, and that the doom of Doriath was \n",
      "drawing nigh. For Melian was of the divine race of the \n",
      "Valar, and she was a Maia of great power and wisdom; but \n",
      "for love of Elwe Singollo she took upon herself the form of \n",
      "the Elder Children of lluvatar, and in that union she became \n",
      "bound by the chain and trammels of the flesh of Arda. In that \n",
      "form she bore to him Luthien Tlnuviel; and in that form she \n",
      "gained a power over the substance of Arda, and by the \n",
      "Girdle of Melian was Doriath defended through long ages \n",
      "from the evils without. But now Thingol lay dead, and his \n",
      "spirit had passed to the halls of Mandos; and with his death \n",
      "a change came also upon Melian. Thus it came to pass that \n",
      "her power was withdrawn in that time from the forests of \n",
      "Neldoreth and Region, and Esgalduin the enchanted river \n",

      "and thus it came to pass, as fate willed, that Maeglin was \n",
      "taken prisoner by Ores, and brought to Angband, Maeglin \n",
      "was no weakling or craven, but the torment wherewith he \n",
      "was threatened cowed his spirit, and he purchased his life \n",
      "and freedom by revealing to Morgoth the very place of \n",
      "Gondolin and the ways whereby it might be found and \n",
      "assailed. Great indeed was the Joy of Morgoth, and to \n",

      "sent him back to Gondolin, lest any should suspect the \n",
      "betrayal, and so that Maeglin should aid the assault from \n",
      "within, when the hour came; and he abode in the halls of the \n",

      "coming stooped upon the Ores, and drove them shrieking \n",
      "back; and all were slain or cast into the deeps, so that \n",
      "rumour of the escape from Gondolin came not until long \n",
      "after to Morgoth's ears. Then Thorondor bore up \n",

      "that they came in time to waters that no vessels save those \n",
      "of the Teleri had known; and they came to the Enchanted \n",
      "Isles and escaped their enchantment; and they came into \n",

      "and at the last they cast anchor in the Bay of Eldamar, and \n",
      "the Teleri saw the coming of that ship out of the East and \n",

      "Silmaril, and it was very great. Then Earendil, first of living \n",
      "Men, landed on the immortal shores; and he spoke there to \n",
      "Elwing and to those that were with him, and they were three \n",
      "mariners who had sailed all the seas besides him: \n",
      "Falathar, Erellont, and Aerandir were their names. And \n",
      "Earendil said to them: 'Here none but myself shall set foot, \n",

      "the Lords of the West upon any of Middle-earth that should \n",
      "dare to pass the leaguer of Aman. And there they bade \n",
      "farewell to the companions of their voyage, and were taken \n",

      "Then Earendil said to Elwing: 'Await me here; for one \n",
      "only may bring the message that it is my fate to bear.' And \n",
      "he went up alone into the land, and came into the Calacirya, \n",
      "and it seemed to him empty and silent; for even as Morgoth \n",
      "and Ungoliant came in ages past, so now Earendil had \n",
      "come at a time of festival, and wellnigh all the Elvenfolk \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "But some there were who saw him from afar, and the \n",
      "great light that he bore; and they went in haste to Valimar. \n",
      "But Earendil climbed the green hill of Tuna and found it \n",

      "were empty; and his heart was heavy, for he feared that \n",
      "some evil had come even to the Blessed Realm. He \n",
      "walked in the deserted ways of Tirion, and the dust upon \n",
      "his raiment and his shoes was a dust of diamonds, and he \n",
      "shone and glistened as he climbed the long white stairs. \n",
      "And he called aloud in many tongues, both of Elves and \n",
      "Men, but there were none to answer him. Therefore he \n",
      "turned back at last towards the sea; but even as he took the \n",
      "shoreward road one stood upon the hill and called to him in \n",
      "a great voice, crying: \n",
      "\n",
      "'Hail Earendil, of mariners most renowned, the looked \n",
      "for that cometh at unawares, the longed for that cometh \n",

      "come before the Powers of Arda. And Earendil went into \n",
      "Valinor and to the halls of Valimar, and never again set foot \n",
      "upon the lands of Men. Then the Valar took counsel \n",
      "together, and they summoned Ulmo from the deeps of the \n",
      "sea; and Earendil stood before their faces, and delivered \n",

      "'For this he was born into the world. And say unto me: \n",
      "whether is he Earendil Tuor's son of the line of Hador, or \n",
      "the son of Idril, Turgon's daughter, of the Elven-house of \n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "he said: 'In this matter the power of doom is given to me. \n",

      "not fall upon Earendil, nor shall it fall upon Elwing his wife, \n",
      "who entered into peril for love of him; but they shall not walk \n",
      "again ever among Elves or Men in the Outer Lands. And \n",
      "this is my decree concerning them: to Earendil and to \n",
      "Elwing, and to their sons, shall be given leave each to \n",

      "fleets. There the Teleri befriended her, and they listened to \n",
      "her tales of Doriath and Gondolin and the griefs of \n",
      "Beleriand, and they were filled with pity and wonder; and \n",
      "there Earendil returning found her, at the Haven of the \n",
      "Swans. But ere long they were summoned to Valimar; and \n",
      "there the decree of the Elder King was declared to them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Earendil said to Elwing: 'Choose thou, for now I \n",
      "am weary of the world.' And Elwing chose to be judged \n",
      "among the Firstborn Children of lluvatar, because of \n",
      "Luthien; and for her sake Earendil chose alike, though his \n",
      "heart was rather with the kindred of Men and the people of \n",
      "his father. Then at the bidding of the Valar Eonwe went to \n",
      "the shore of Aman, where the companions of Earendil still \n",
      "remained, awaiting tidings; and he took a boat, and the \n",
      "three mariners were set therein, and the Valar drove them \n",
      "away into the East with a great wind. But they took Vingilot, \n",
      "and hallowed it, and bore it away through Valinor to the \n",
      "uttermost rim of the world; and there it passed through the \n",
      "Door of Night and was lifted up even into the oceans of \n",
      "heaven. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now fair and marvellous was that vessel made, and it \n",
      "was filled with a wavering flame, pure and bright; and \n",
      "Earendil the Mariner sat at the helm, glistening with dust of \n",
      "elven-gems, and the Silmaril was bound upon his brow. Far \n",
      "he journeyed in that ship, even into the starless voids; but \n",
      "most often was he seen at morning or at evening, \n",
      "glimmering in sunrise or sunset, as he came back to \n",
      "Valinor from voyages beyond the confines of the world. \n",
      "\n",
      "On those journeys Elwing did not go, for she might not \n",
      "endure the cold and the pathless voids, and she loved \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "rather the earth and the sweet winds that blow on sea and \n",
      "hill. Therefore there was built for her a white tower \n",
      "northward upon the borders of the Sundering Seas; and \n",
      "thither at times all the sea-birds of the earth repaired. And it \n",
      "is said that Elwing learned the tongues of birds, who herself \n",
      "had once worn their shape; and they taught her the craft of \n",
      "flight, and her wings were of white and silver-grey. And at \n",
      "times, when Earendil returning drew near again to Arda, \n",
      "she would fly to meet him, even as she had flown long ago, \n",
      "when she was rescued from the sea. Then the far-sighted \n",
      "among the Elves that dwelt in the Lonely Isle would see her \n",
      "like a white bird, shining, rose-stained in the sunset, as she \n",
      "soared in joy to greet the coming ofVingilotto haven. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now when first Vingilot was set to sail in the seas of \n",
      "heaven, it rose unlocked for, glittering and bright; and the \n",
      "people of Middle-earth beheld it from afar and wondered, \n",
      "and they took it for a sign, and called it Gil-Estel, the Star of \n",
      "High Hope. And when this new star was seen at evening, \n",
      "Maedhros spoke to Maglor his brother, and he said: 'Surely \n",
      "that is a Silmaril that shines now in the West?' \n",
      "\n",
      "And Maglor answered: 'If it be truly the Silmaril which \n",
      "we saw cast into the sea that rises again by the power of \n",
      "the Valar, then let us be glad; for its glory is seen now by \n",
      "many, and is yet secure from all evil.' Then the Elves looked \n",
      "up, and despaired no longer; but Morgoth was filled with \n",
      "doubt. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yet it is said that Morgoth looked not for the assault \n",
      "that came upon him from the West; for so great was his \n",
      "pride become that he deemed that none would ever again \n",
      "come with open war against him. Moreover he thought that \n",
      "he had for ever estranged the Noldor from the Lords of the \n",
      "West, and that content in their blissful realm the Valar would \n",
      "heed no more his kingdom in the world without; for to him \n",
      "that is pitiless the deeds of pity are ever strange and \n",
      "beyond reckoning. But the host of the Valar prepared for \n",
      "battle; and beneath their white banners marched the \n",
      "Vanyar, the people of Ingwe, and those also of the Noldor \n",
      "who never departed from Valinor, whose leader was \n",
      "Finarfin the son of Finwe. Few of the Teleri were willing to \n",
      "go forth to war, for they remembered the slaying at the \n",
      "Swan-haven, and the rape of their ships; but they \n",
      "hearkened to Elwing, who was the daughter of Dior Eluchil \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "and come of their own kindred, and they sent mariners \n",
      "enough to sail the ships that bore the host of Valinor east \n",
      "over the sea. Yet they stayed aboard their vessels, and \n",
      "none of them set foot upon the Hither Lands. \n",
      "\n",
      "Of the march of the host of the Valar to the north of \n",
      "Middle-earth little is said in any tale; for among them went \n",
      "none of those Elves who had dwelt and suffered in the \n",
      "Hither Lands, and who made the histories of those days \n",
      "that still are known; and tidings of these things they only \n",
      "learned long afterwards from their kinsfolk in Aman. But at \n",
      "the last the might of Valinor came up out of the West, and \n",
      "the challenge of the trumpets of Eonwe filled the sky; and \n",
      "Beleriand was ablaze with the glory of their arms, for the \n",
      "host of the Valar were arrayed in forms young and fair and \n",
      "terrible, and the mountains rang beneath their feet. \n",
      "\n",
      "The meeting of the hosts of the West and of the North \n",
      "is named the Great Battle, and the War of Wrath. There \n",
      "was marshalled the whole power of the Throne of Morgoth, \n",
      "and it had become great beyond count, so that Anfauglith \n",
      "could not contain it; and all the North was aflame with war. \n",
      "\n",
      "But it availed him not. The Balrogs were destroyed, \n",
      "save some few that fled and hid themselves in caverns \n",
      "inaccessible at the roots of the earth; and the uncounted \n",
      "legions of the Ores perished like straw in a great fire, or \n",
      "were swept like shrivelled leaves before a burning wind. \n",
      "Few remained to trouble the world for long years after. And \n",
      "such few as were left of the three houses of the Elf-friends, \n",
      "Fathers of Men, fought upon the part of the Valar; and they \n",
      "were avenged in those days for Baragund and Barahir, \n",
      "Galdor and Gundor, Huor and Hurin, and many others of \n",
      "their lords. But a great part of the sons of Men, whether of \n",
      "the people of Uldor or others new-come out of the east, \n",
      "marched with the Enemy; and the Elves do not forget it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then, seeing that his hosts were overthrown and his \n",
      "power dispersed, Morgoth quailed, and he dared not to \n",
      "come forth himself. But he loosed upon his foes the last \n",
      "desperate assault that he had prepared, and out of the pits \n",
      "of Angband there issued the winged dragons, that had not \n",
      "before been seen; and so sudden and ruinous was the \n",
      "onset of that dreadful fleet that the host of the Valar was \n",
      "driven back, for the coming of the dragons was with great \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "thunder, and lightning, and a tempest of fire. \n",
      "\n",
      "But Earendil came, shining with white flame, and about \n",
      "Vingilot were gathered all the great birds of heaven and \n",
      "Thorondor was their captain, and there was battle in the air \n",
      "all the day and through a dark night of doubt. Before the \n",
      "rising of the sun Earendil slew Ancalagon the Black, the \n",
      "mightiest of the dragon-host, and cast him from the sky; \n",
      "and he fell upon the towers of Thangorodrim, and they were \n",
      "broken in his ruin. Then the sun rose, and the host of the \n",
      "Valar prevailed, and well-nigh all the dragons were \n",
      "destroyed; and all the pits of Morgoth were broken and \n",
      "unroofed, and the might of the Valar descended into the \n",
      "deeps of the earth. There Morgoth stood at last at bay, and \n",
      "yet unvaliant. He fled into the deepest of his mines, and \n",
      "sued for peace and pardon; but his feet were hewn from \n",
      "under him, and he was hurled upon his face. Then he was \n",
      "bound with the chain Angainor which he had worn \n",
      "aforetime, and his iron crown they beat into a collar for his \n",
      "neck, and his head was bowed upon his knees. And the \n",
      "two Silmarils which remained to Morgoth were taken from \n",
      "his crown, and they shone unsullied beneath the sky; and \n",
      "Eonwe took them, and guarded them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus an end was made of the power of Angband in the \n",
      "North, and' the evil realm was brought to naught; and out of \n",
      "the deep prisons a multitude of slaves came forth beyond \n",
      "all hope into the light of day, and they looked upon a world \n",
      "that was changed. For so great was the fury of those \n",
      "adversaries that the northern regions of the western world \n",
      "were rent asunder, and the sea roared in through many \n",
      "chasms, and there was confusion and great noise; and \n",
      "rivers perished or found new paths, and the valleys were \n",
      "upheaved and the hills trod down; and Sirion was no more. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Eonwe as herald of the Elder King summoned \n",
      "the Elves of Beleriand to depart from Middle-earth. But \n",
      "Maedhros and Maglor would not hearken, and they \n",
      "prepared, though now with weariness and loathing, to \n",
      "attempt in despair the fulfilment of their oath; for they would \n",
      "have given battle for the Silmarils, were they withheld, even \n",
      "against the victorious host of Valinor, even though they \n",
      "stood alone against all the world. And they sent a message \n",
      "therefore to Eonwe, bidding him yield up now those jewels \n",
      "which of old Feanor their father made and Morgoth stole \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "from him. \n",
      "\n",
      "But Eonwe answered that the right to the work of their \n",
      "father, which the sons of Feanor formerly possessed, had \n",
      "now perished, because of their many and merciless deeds, \n",
      "being blinded by their oath, and most of all because of their \n",
      "slaying of Dior and the assault upon the Havens. The light \n",
      "of the Silmarils should go now into the West, whence it \n",
      "came in the beginning; and to Valinor must Maedhros and \n",
      "Maglor return, and there abide the judgement of the Valar, \n",
      "by whose decree alone would Eonwe yield the jewels from \n",
      "his charge. Then Maglor desired indeed to submit, for his \n",
      "heart was sorrowful, and he said: The oath says not that we \n",
      "may not bide our time, and it may be that in Valinor all shall \n",
      "be forgiven and forgot, and we shall come into our own in \n",
      "peace. \n",
      "\n",
      "But Maedhros answered that if they returned to Aman \n",
      "but the favour of the Valar were withheld from them, then \n",
      "their oath would still remain, but its fulfilment be beyond all \n",
      "hope; and he said: 'Who can tell to what dreadful doom we \n",
      "shall come, if we disobey the Powers in their own land, or \n",
      "purpose ever to bring war again into their holy realm?' \n",
      "\n",
      "Yet Maglor still held back, saying: 'If Manwe and Varda \n",
      "themselves deny the fulfilment of an oath to which we \n",
      "named them in witness, is it not made void?' \n",
      "\n",
      "And Maedhros answered: 'But how shall our voices \n",
      "reach to lluvatar beyond the Circles of the World? And by \n",
      "lluvatar we swore in our madness, and called the \n",
      "Everlasting Darkness upon us, if we kept not our word. \n",
      "Who shall release us?' \n",
      "\n",
      "'If none can release us,' said Maglor, 'then indeed the \n",
      "Everlasting Darkness shall be our lot, whether we keep our \n",
      "oath or break it; but less evil shall we do in the breaking.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Yet he yielded at last to the will of Maedhros, and they \n",
      "took counsel together how they should lay hands on the \n",
      "Silmarils. And they disguised themselves, and came in the \n",
      "night to the camp of Eonwe, and crept into the place where \n",
      "the Silmarils were guarded; and they slew the guards, and \n",
      "laid hands on the jewels. Then all the camp was raised \n",
      "against them, and they prepared to die, defending \n",
      "themselves until the last. But Eonwe would not permit the \n",
      "slaying of the sons of Feanor; and departing unfought they \n",
      "fled far away. Each of them took to himself a Silmaril, for \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "they said: 'Since one is lost to us, and but two remain, and \n",
      "we two alone of our brothers, so is it plain that fate would \n",
      "have us share the heirlooms of our father.' \n",
      "\n",
      "But the jewel burned the hand of Maedhros in pain \n",
      "unbearable; and he perceived that it was as Eonwe had \n",
      "said, and that his right thereto had become void, and that \n",
      "the oath was vain. And being in anguish and despair he \n",
      "cast himself into a gaping chasm filled with fire, and so \n",
      "ended; and the Silmaril that he bore was taken into the \n",
      "bosom of the Earth, \n",
      "\n",
      "And it is told of Maglor that he could not endure the \n",
      "pain with which the Silmaril tormented him; and he cast it at \n",
      "last into the Sea, and thereafter he wandered ever upon the \n",
      "shores, singing in pain and regret beside the waves. For \n",
      "Maglor was mighty among the singers of old, named only \n",
      "after Daeron of Doriath; but he came never back among \n",
      "the people of the Elves. And thus it came to pass that the \n",
      "Silmarils found their long homes: one in the airs of heaven, \n",
      "and one in the fires of the heart of the world, and one in the \n",
      "deep waters. \n",
      "\n",
      "In those days there was a great building of ships upon \n",
      "the shores of the Western Sea; and thence in many a fleet \n",
      "the Eldar set sail into the West, and came never back to the \n",
      "lands of weeping and of war. And the Vanya r returned \n",
      "beneath their white banners, and were borne in triumph to \n",
      "Valinor; but their joy in victory was diminished, for they \n",
      "returned without the Silmarils from Morgoth's crown, and \n",
      "they knew that those jewels could not be found or brought \n",
      "together again unless the world be broken and remade. \n",
      "\n",
      "And when they came into the West the Elves of \n",
      "Beleriand dwelt upon Tol Eressea, the Lonely Isle, that \n",
      "looks both west and east; whence they might come even to \n",
      "Valinor. They were admitted again to the love of Manwe \n",
      "and the pardon of the Valar; and the Teleri forgave their \n",
      "ancient grief, and the curse was laid to rest. \n",

      "overthrown and Thangorodrim was broken, the Edain alone \n",
      "of the kindreds of Men fought for the Valar, whereas many \n",
      "others fought for Morgoth. And after the victory of the Lords \n",
      "of the West those of the evil Men who were not destroyed \n",
      "fled back into the east, where many of their race were still \n",
      "wandering in the unharvested lands, wild and lawless, \n",
      "refusing alike the summons of the Valar and of Morgoth. \n",
      "And the evil Men came among them, and cast over them a \n",

      "But Manwe put forth Morgoth and shut him beyond the \n",
      "World in the Void that is without; and he cannot himself \n",
      "return again into the World, present and visible, while the \n",
      "Lords of the West are still enthroned. Yet the seeds that he \n",
      "had planted still grew and sprouted, bearing evil fruit, if any \n",
      "would tend them. For his will remained and guided his \n",
      "servants, moving them ever to thwart the will of the Valar \n",
      "and to destroy those that obeyed them. This the Lords of \n",
      "the West knew full well. When therefore Morgoth had been \n",
      "thrust forth, they held council concerning the ages that \n",
      "should come after. The Eldar they summoned to return into \n",
      "the West, and those that hearkened to the summons dwelt \n",
      "in the Isle of Eressea; and there is in that land a haven that \n",
      "is named Avallone, for it is of all cities the nearest to \n",
      "Valinor, and the tower of Avallone is the first sight that the \n",
      "mariner beholds when at last he draws nigh to the Undying \n",
      "Lands over the leagues of the Sea. To the Fathers of Men \n",
      "of the three faithful houses rich reward also was given. \n",
      "Eonwe came among them and taught them; and they were \n",
      "given wisdom and power and life more enduring than any \n",
      "others of mortal race have possessed. A land was made \n",
      "for the Edain to dwell in, neither part of Middle-earth nor of \n",
      "Valinor, for it was sundered from either by a wide sea; yet it \n",
      "was nearer to Valinor. It was raised by Osse out of the \n",
      "depths of the Great Water, and it was established by Aule \n",
      "and enriched by Yavanna; and the Eldar brought thither \n",
      "flowers and fountains out of Tol Eressea. That land the \n",
      "Valar called Andor, the Land of Gift; and the Star of \n",
      "Earendil shone bright in the West as a token that all was \n",
      "made ready, and as a guide over the sea; and Men \n",
      "marvelled to see that silver flame in the paths of the Sun. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the waters glittered before the eyes of the Edain like \n",
      "rippling glass, and the foam flew like snow before the \n",
      "stems of their ships. But so bright was Rothinzil that even at \n",
      "morning Men could see it glimmering in the West, and in \n",
      "the cloudless night it shone alone, for no other star could \n",
      "stand beside it. And setting their course towards it the \n",
      "Edain came at last over leagues of sea and saw afar the \n",
      "land that was prepared for them, Andor, the Land of Gift, \n",
      "shimmering in a golden haze. Then they went up out of the \n",
      "sea and found a country fair and fruitful, and they were glad. \n",
      "And they called that land Elenna, which is Starwards; but \n",
      "also Anadune, which is Westernesse, Numenore in the \n",
      "High Eldarin tongue. \n",
      "\n",
      "This was the beginning of that people that in the Grey- \n",
      "elven speech are called the Dunedain: the Numenoreans, \n",
      "Kings among Men. But they did not thus escape from the \n",
      "doom of death that lluvatar had set upon all Mankind, and \n",
      "they were mortal still, though their years were long, and they \n",
      "knew no sickness, ere the shadow fell upon them. \n",
      "Therefore they grew wise and glorious, and in all things \n",
      "more like to the Firstborn than any other of the kindreds of \n",
      "Men; and they were tall, taller than the tallest of the sons of \n",
      "Middle-earth; and the light of their eyes was like the bright \n",
      "stars. But their numbers increased only slowly in the land, \n",
      "for though daughters and sons were born to them, fairer \n",
      "than their fathers, yet their children were few. \n",
      "\n",
      "Of old the chief city and haven of Numenor was in the \n",
      "midst of its western coasts, and it was called Andunie \n",
      "because it faced the sunset. But in the midst of the land \n",
      "was a mountain tall and steep, and it was named the \n",
      "Meneltarma, the Pillar of Heaven, and upon it was a high \n",
      "place that was hallowed to Eru lluvatar, and it was open and \n",
      "unroofed, and no other temple or fane was there in the land \n",
      "of the Numenoreans. At the feet of the mountain were built \n",
      "the tombs of the Kings, and hard by upon a hill was \n",
      "Armenelos, fairest of cities, and there stood the tower and \n",
      "the citadel that was raised by Elros son of Earendil, whom \n",
      "the Valar appointed to be the first King of the Dunedain. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now Elros and Elrond his brother were descended \n",
      "from the Three Houses of the Edain, but in part also both \n",
      "from the Eldar and the Maiar; for Idril of Gondolin and \n",
      "Luthien daughter of Melian were their fore-mothers. The \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Valar indeed may not withdraw the gift of death, which \n",
      "comes to Men from lluvatar, but in the matter of the Half- \n",
      "elven lluvatar gave to them the judgement; and they judged \n",
      "that to the sons of Earendil should be given choice of their \n",
      "own destiny. And Elrond chose to remain with the Firstborn, \n",
      "and to him the life of the Firstborn was granted. But to \n",
      "Elros, who chose to be a king of Men, still a great span of \n",
      "years was allotted, many times that of the Men of Middle- \n",
      "earth; and all his line, the kings and lords of the royal house, \n",
      "had long life even according to the measure of the \n",
      "Numenoreans. But Elros lived five hundred years, and ruled \n",
      "the Numenoreans four hundred years and ten. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus the years passed, and while Middle-earth went \n",
      "backward and light and wisdom faded, the Dunedain dwelt \n",
      "under the protection of the Valar and in the friendship of the \n",
      "Eldar, and they increased in stature both of mind and body. \n",
      "For though this people used still their own speech, their \n",
      "kings and lords knew and spoke also the Elven tongue, \n",
      "which they had learned in the days of their alliance, and \n",
      "thus they held converse still with the Eldar, whether of \n",
      "Eressea or of the west-lands of Middle-earth. And the \n",
      "loremasters among them learned also the High Eldarin \n",
      "tongue of the Blessed Realm, in which much story and song \n",
      "was preserved from the beginning of the world; and they \n",
      "made letters and scrolls and books, and wrote in them \n",
      "many things of wisdom and wonder in the high tide of their \n",
      "realm, of which all is now forgot. So it came to pass that, \n",
      "beside their own names, all the lords of the Numenoreans \n",
      "had also Eldarin names; and the like with the cities and fair \n",
      "places that they founded in Numenor and on the shores of \n",
      "the Hither Lands. \n",
      "\n",
      "For the Dunedain became mighty in crafts, so that if \n",
      "they had had the mind they could easily have surpassed the \n",
      "evil kings of Middle-earth in the making of war and the \n",
      "forging of weapons; but they were become men of peace. \n",
      "Above all arts they nourished shipbuilding and sea-craft, \n",
      "and they became mariners whose like shall never be again \n",
      "since the world was diminished; and voyaging upon the \n",
      "wide seas was the chief feat and adventure of their hardy \n",
      "men in the gallant days of their youth. \n",
      "\n",
      "But the Lords of Valinor forbade them to sail so far \n",
      "westward that the coasts of Numenor could no longer be \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "seen; and for long the Dunedain were content, though they \n",
      "did not fully understand the purpose of this ban. But the \n",
      "design of Manwe was that the Numenoreans should not be \n",
      "tempted to seek for the Blessed Realm, nor desire to \n",
      "overpass the limits set to their bliss, becoming enamoured \n",
      "of the immortality of the Valar and the Eldar and the lands \n",
      "where all things endure. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For in those days Valinor still remained in the world \n",
      "visible, and there lluvatar permitted the Valar to maintain \n",
      "upon Earth an abiding place, a memorial of that which \n",
      "might have been if Morgoth had not cast his shadow on the \n",
      "world. This the Numenoreans knew full well; and at times, \n",
      "when all the air was clear and the sun was in the east, they \n",
      "would look out and descry far off in the west a city white- \n",
      "shining on a distant shore, and a great harbour and a \n",
      "tower. For in those days the Numenoreans were far- \n",
      "sighted; yet even so it was only the keenest eyes among \n",
      "them that could see this vision, from the Meneltarma, \n",
      "maybe, or from some tall ship that lay off their western \n",
      "coast as far as it was lawful for them to go. For they did not \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "dare to break the Ban of the Lords of the West. But the \n",
      "wise among them knew that this distant land was not \n",
      "indeed the Blessed Realm of Valinor, but was Avallone, the \n",
      "haven of the Eldar upon Eressea, easternmost of the \n",
      "Undying Lands. And thence at times the Firstborn still \n",
      "would come sailing to Numenor in oarless boats, as white \n",
      "birds flying from the sunset. And they brought to Numenor \n",
      "many gifts: birds of song, and fragrant flowers, and herbs of \n",
      "great virtue. And a seedling they brought of Celeborn, the \n",
      "White Tree that grew in the midst of Eressea; and that was \n",
      "in its turn a seedling of Galathilion the Tree of Tuna, the \n",
      "image of Telperion that Yavanna gave to the Eldar in the \n",
      "Blessed Realm. And the tree grew and blossomed in the \n",
      "courts of the King inArmenelos; Nimloth it was named, and \n",
      "flowered in the evening, and the shadows of night it filled \n",
      "with its fragrance. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus it was that because of the Ban of the Valar the \n",
      "voyages of the Dunedain in those days went ever eastward \n",
      "and not westward, from the darkness of the North to the \n",
      "heats of the South, and beyond the South to the Nether \n",
      "Darkness; and they came even into the inner seas, and \n",
      "sailed about Middle-earth and glimpsed from their high \n",
      "prows the Gates of Morning in the East. And the Dunedain \n",
      "came at times to the shores of the Great Lands, and they \n",
      "took pity on the forsaken world of Middle-earth; and the \n",
      "Lords of Numenor set foot again upon the western shores \n",
      "in the Dark Years of Men, and none yet dared to withstand \n",
      "them. For most of the Men of that age that sat under the \n",
      "Shadow were now grown weak and fearful. And coming \n",
      "among them the Numenoreans taught them many things. \n",
      "Corn and wine they brought, and they instructed Men in the \n",
      "sowing of seed and the grinding of grain, in the hewing of \n",
      "wood and the shaping of stone, and in the ordering of their \n",
      "life, such as it might be in the lands of swift death and little \n",
      "bliss. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Men of Middle-earth were comforted, and \n",
      "here and there upon the western shores the houseless \n",
      "woods drew back, and Men shook off the yoke of the \n",
      "offspring of Morgoth, and unlearned their terror of the dark. \n",
      "And they revered the memory of the tall Sea-kings, and \n",
      "when they had departed they called them gods, hoping for \n",
      "their return; for at that time the Numenoreans dwelt never \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "long in Middle-earth, nor made there as yet any habitation \n",
      "of their own. Eastward they must sail, but ever west their \n",
      "hearts returned. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now this yearning grew ever greater with the years; \n",
      "and the Numenoreans began to hunger for the undying city \n",
      "that they saw from afar, and the desire of everlasting life, to \n",
      "escape from death and the ending of delight, grew strong \n",
      "upon them; and ever as their power and glory grew greater \n",
      "their unquiet increased. For though the Valar had rewarded \n",
      "the Dunedain with long life, they could not take from them \n",
      "the weariness of the world that comes at last, and they \n",
      "died, even their kings of the seed of Earendil; and the span \n",
      "of their lives was brief in the eyes of the Eldar. Thus it was \n",
      "that a shadow fell upon them: in which maybe the will of \n",
      "Morgoth was at work that still moved in the world. And the \n",
      "Numenoreans began to murmur, at first in their hearts, and \n",
      "then in open words, against the doom of Men, and most of \n",
      "all against the Ban which forbade them to sail into the \n",
      "West. \n",
      "\n",
      "And they said among themselves: 'Why do the Lords \n",
      "of the West sit there in peace unending, while we must die \n",
      "and go we know not whither, leaving our home and all that \n",
      "we have made? And the Eldar die not, even those that \n",
      "rebelled against the Lords. And since we have mastered all \n",
      "seas, and no water is so wild or so wide that our ships \n",
      "cannot overcome it, why should we not go to Avallone and \n",
      "greet there our friends?' \n",
      "\n",
      "And some there were who said: 'Why should we not go \n",
      "even to Aman, and taste there, were it but for a day, the \n",
      "bliss of the Powers? Have we not become mighty among \n",
      "the people of Arda?' \n",
      "\n",
      "The Eldar reported these words to the Valar, and \n",
      "Manwe was grieved, seeing a cloud gather on the noontide \n",
      "of Numenor. And he sent messengers to the Dunedain, \n",
      "who spoke earnestly to the King, and to all who would \n",
      "listen, concerning the fate and fashion of the world. \n",
      "\n",
      "'The Doom of the World,' they said, 'One alone can \n",
      "change who made it. And were you so to voyage that \n",
      "escaping all deceits and snares you came indeed to Aman, \n",
      "the Blessed Realm, little would it profit you. For it is not the \n",
      "land of Manwe that makes its people deathless, but the \n",
      "Deathless that dwell therein have hallowed the land; and \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "there you would but wither and grow weary the sooner, as \n",
      "moths in a light too strong and steadfast.' \n",
      "\n",
      "But the King said: 'And does not Earendil, my \n",
      "forefather, live? Or is he not in the land of Aman?' \n",
      "\n",
      "To which they answered: 'You know that he has a fate \n",
      "apart, and was adjudged to the Firstborn who die not; yet \n",
      "this also is his doom that he can never return again to \n",
      "mortal lands. Whereas you and your people are not of the \n",
      "Firstborn, but are mortal Men as lluvatar made you. Yet it \n",
      "seems that you desire now to have the good of both \n",
      "kindreds, to sail to Valinor when you will, and to return when \n",
      "you please to your homes. That cannot be. Nor can the \n",
      "Valar take away the gifts of lluvatar. The Eldar, you say, are \n",
      "unpunished, and even those who rebelled do not die. Yet \n",
      "that is to them neither reward nor punishment, but the \n",
      "fulfilment of their being. They cannot escape, and are \n",
      "bound to this world, never to leave it so long as it lasts, for \n",
      "its life is theirs. And you are punished for the rebellion of \n",
      "Men, you say, in which you had small part, and so it is that \n",
      "you die. But that was not at first appointed for a \n",
      "punishment. Thus you escape, and leave the world, and are \n",
      "not bound to it, in hope or in weariness. Which of us \n",
      "therefore should envy the others?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "And the Numenoreans answered: 'Why should we not \n",
      "envy the Valar, or even the least of the Deathless? For of us \n",
      "is required a blind trust, and a hope without assurance, \n",
      "knowing not what lies before us in a little while. And yet we \n",
      "also love the Earth and would not lose it.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Messengers said: 'Indeed the mind of lluvatar \n",
      "concerning you is not known to the Valar, and he has not \n",
      "revealed all things that are to come. But this we hold to be \n",
      "true, that your home is not here, neither in the Land of Aman \n",
      "nor anywhere within the Circles of the World. And the Doom \n",
      "of Men, that they should depart, was at first a gift of lluvatar. \n",
      "It became a grief to them only because coming under the \n",
      "shadow of Morgoth it seemed to them that they were \n",
      "surrounded by a great darkness, of which they were afraid; \n",
      "and some grew wilful and proud and would not yield, until \n",
      "life was reft from them. We who bear the ever-mounting \n",
      "burden of the years do not clearly understand this; but if that \n",
      "grief has returned to trouble you, as you say, then we fear \n",
      "that the Shadow arises once more and grows again in your \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hearts. Therefore, though you be the Dunedain, fairest of \n",
      "Men, who escaped from the Shadow of old and fought \n",
      "valiantly against it, we say to you: Beware! The will of Eru \n",
      "may not be gainsaid; and the Valar bid you earnestly not to \n",
      "withhold the trust to which you are called, lest soon it \n",
      "become again a bond by which you are constrained. Hope \n",
      "rather that in the end even the least of your desires shall \n",
      "have fruit. The love of Arda was set in your hearts by \n",
      "lluvatar, and he does not plant to no purpose. Nonetheless, \n",
      "many ages of Men unborn may pass ere that purpose is \n",
      "made known; and to you it will be revealed and not to the \n",
      "Valar.' \n",
      "\n",
      "These things took place in the days of Tar-Ciryatan the \n",

      "proud men, eager for wealth, and they laid the men of \n",
      "Middle-earth under tribute, taking now rather than giving. It \n",
      "was to Tar-Atanamir that the Messengers came; and he \n",
      "was the thirteenth King, and in his day the Realm of \n",
      "Numenor had endured for more than two thousand years, \n",
      "and was come to the zenith of its bliss, if not yet of its \n",

      "and he was of like mind; and in his day the people of \n",
      "Numenor became divided. On the one hand was the \n",
      "greater party, and they were called the King's Men, and \n",
      "they grew proud and were estranged from the Eldar and the \n",
      "Valar. And on the other hand was the lesser party, and they \n",
      "were called the Elendili, the Elf-friends; for though they \n",
      "remained loyal indeed to the King and the House of Elros, \n",
      "they wished to keep the friendship of the Eldar, and they \n",
      "hearkened to the counsel of the Lords of the West. \n",

      "\n",
      "Nonetheless even they, who named themselves the Faithful, \n",
      "did not wholly escape from the affliction of their people, and \n",
      "they were troubled by the thought of death. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus the bliss of Westernesse became diminished; \n",
      "but still its might and splendour increased. For the kings \n",
      "and their people had not yet abandoned wisdom, and if \n",
      "they loved the Valar no longer at least they still feared them. \n",
      "They did not dare openly to break the Ban or to sail beyond \n",
      "the limits that had been appointed. Eastwards still they \n",
      "steered their tall ships. But the fear of death grew ever \n",
      "darker upon them, and they delayed it by all means that \n",
      "they could; and they began to build great houses for their \n",
      "dead, while their wise men laboured unceasingly to \n",
      "discover if they might the secret of recalling life, or at the \n",
      "least of the prolonging of Men's days. Yet they achieved \n",
      "only the art of preserving incorrupt the dead flesh of Men, \n",
      "and they filled all the land with silent tombs in which the \n",
      "thought of death was enshrined in the darkness. But those \n",
      "that lived turned the more eagerly to pleasure and revelry, \n",
      "desiring ever more goods and more riches; and after the \n",
      "days of Tar-Ancalimon the offering of the first fruits to Eru \n",
      "was neglected, and men went seldom any more to the \n",
      "Hallow upon the heights of Meneltarma in the midst of the \n",
      "land. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus it came to pass in that time that the \n",
      "Numenoreans first made great settlements upon the west \n",
      "shores of the ancient lands; for their own land seemed to \n",
      "them shrunken, and they had no rest or content therein, and \n",
      "they desired now wealth and dominion in Middle-earth, \n",
      "since the West was denied. Great harbours and strong \n",
      "towers they made, and there many of them took up their \n",
      "abode; but they appeared now rather as lords and masters \n",
      "and gatherers of tribute than as helpers and teachers. And \n",
      "the great ships of the Numenoreans were borne east on the \n",
      "winds and returned ever laden, and the power and majesty \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "King of Numenor, he had fortified the land of Mordor and \n",
      "had built there the Tower of Barad-dur, and thereafter he \n",

      "the One Ring was forged and there was war between \n",
      "Sauron and the Elves in Eriador. Now he learned that the \n",

      "and he hated them the more; and he feared them, lest they \n",
      "should invade his lands and wrest from him the dominion of \n",

      "Yet Sauron was ever guileful, and it is said that among \n",
      "those whom he ensnared with the Nine Rings three were \n",
      "great lords of Numenorean race. And when the Ulairi arose \n",
      "that were the Ring-wraiths, his servants, and the strength of \n",

      "waned because of their rebellion, but they hardened their \n",
      "hearts the more against the Valar. And the nineteenth king \n",
      "took the sceptre of his fathers, and he ascended the throne \n",
      "in the name of Adunakhor, Lord of the West, forsaking the \n",

      "Gimilzor the twenty-second king was the greatest enemy of \n",
      "the Faithful. In his day the White Tree was untended and \n",
      "began to decline; and he forbade utterly the use of the \n",

      "dwell in the east of the land; and there they were watched. \n",
      "And the chief dwelling of the Faithful in the later days was \n",

      "This was known to the kings, but they hindered it not, so \n",

      "they did was known to Manwe, and the Valar were wroth \n",
      "with the Kings of Numenor, and gave them counsel and \n",
      "protection no more; and the ships of Eressea came never \n",
      "again out of the sunset, and the havens of Andunie were \n",
      "forlorn. \n",
      "\n",
      "Highest in honour after the house of the kings were the \n",
      "Lords of Andunie; for they were of the line of Elros, being \n",
      "descended from Silmarien, daughter of Tar-Elendil the \n",
      "fourth king of Numenor. And these lords were loyal to the \n",
      "kings, and revered them; and the Lord of Andunie was ever \n",
      "among the chief councillors of the Sceptre. Yet also from \n",
      "the beginning they bore especial love to the Eldar and \n",
      "reverence for the Valar; and as the Shadow grew they \n",
      "aided the Faithful as they could. But for long they did not \n",
      "declare themselves openly, and sought rather to amend the \n",
      "hearts of the lords of the Sceptre with wiser counsels. \n",
      "\n",
      "There was a lady Inzilbeth, renowned for her beauty, \n",
      "and her mother was Lindorie, sister of Earendur, the Lord \n",
      "of Andunie in the days of Ar-Sakalthor father of Ar-Gimilzor. \n",
      "Gimilzor took her to wife, though this was little to her liking, \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "mother; but the kings and their sons were grown proud and \n",
      "not to be gainsaid in their wishes. No love was there \n",
      "between Ar-Gi mi Izor and his queen, or between their sons. \n",
      "Inziladun, the elder, was like his mother in mind as in body; \n",
      "but Gimilkhad, the younger, went with his father, unless he \n",
      "were yet prouder and more wilful. To him Ar-Gi mi Izor would \n",
      "have yielded the sceptre rather than to the elder son, if the \n",
      "laws had allowed. \n",
      "\n",
      "But when Inziladun acceded to the sceptre, he took \n",
      "again a title in the Elven-tongue as of old, calling himself \n",
      "Tar-Palantir, for he was far-sighted both in eye and in mind, \n",
      "and even those that hated him feared his words as those of \n",
      "a true-seer. He gave peace for a while to the Faithful; and \n",
      "he went once more at due seasons to the Hallow of Eru \n",
      "upon the Meneltarma, which Ar-Gi mi Izor had forsaken. The \n",
      "White Tree he tended again with honour; and he \n",
      "prophesied, saying that when the Tree perished, then also \n",
      "would the line of the Kings come to its end. But his \n",
      "repentance was too late to appease the anger of the Valar \n",
      "with the insolence of his fathers, of which the greater part of \n",
      "his people did not repent. And Gimilkhad was strong and \n",
      "ungentle, and he took the leadership of those that had been \n",
      "called the King's Men and opposed the will of his brother as \n",
      "openly as he dared, and yet more in secret. Thus the days \n",
      "of Tar-Palantir became darkened with grief; and he would \n",
      "spend much of his time in the west, and there ascended \n",
      "often the ancient tower of King Minastir upon the hill of \n",
      "Oromet nigh to Andunie, whence he gazed westward in \n",
      "yearning, hoping to see, maybe, some sail upon the sea. \n",
      "But no ship came ever again from the West to Numenor, \n",
      "and Avallone was veiled in cloud. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now Gimilkhad died two years before his two \n",
      "hundredth year (which was accounted an early death for \n",
      "one of Elros' line even in its waning), but this brought no \n",
      "peace to the King. For Pharazon son of Gimilkhad had \n",
      "become a man yet more restless and eager for wealth and \n",
      "power than his father. He had fared often abroad, as a \n",
      "leader in the wars that the Numenoreans made then in the \n",
      "coastlands of Middle-earth, seeking to extend their \n",
      "dominion over Men; and thus he had won great renown as \n",
      "a captain both by land and by sea. Therefore when he \n",
      "came back to Numenor, hearing of his father's death, the \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "hearts of the people were turned to him; for he brought with \n",
      "him great wealth, and was for the time free in his giving. \n",
      "\n",
      "And it came to pass that Tar-Palantir grew weary of \n",
      "grief and died. He had no son, but a daughter only, whom \n",
      "he named Miriel in the Elven-tongue; and to her now by right \n",
      "and the laws of the Numenoreans came the sceptre. But \n",
      "Pharazon took her to wife against her will, doing evil in this \n",
      "and evil also in that the laws of Numenor did not permit the \n",
      "marriage, even in the royal house, of those more nearly \n",
      "akin than cousins in the second degree. And when they \n",
      "were wedded, he seized the sceptre into his own hand, \n",
      "taking the title of Ar-Pharazon (Tar-Calion in the Elven- \n",
      "tongue); and the name of his queen he changed to Ar- \n",
      "Zimraphel. \n",
      "\n",
      "The mightiest and proudest was Ar-Pharazon the \n",
      "Golden of all those that had wielded the Sceptre of the \n",
      "Sea-Kings since the foundation of Numenor; and three and \n",
      "twenty Kings and Queens had ruled the Numenoreans \n",
      "before, and slept now in their deep tombs under the mount \n",
      "of Meneltarma, lying upon beds of gold. \n",
      "\n",
      "And sitting upon his carven throne in the city of \n",
      "Armenelos in the glory of his power, he brooded darkly, \n",
      "thinking of war. For he had learned in Middle-earth of the \n",
      "strength of the realm of Sauron, and of his hatred of \n",
      "Westernesse. And now there came to him the masters of \n",
      "ships and captains returning out of the East, and they \n",
      "reported that Sauron was putting forth his might, since Ar- \n",
      "Pharazon had gone back from Middle-earth, and he was \n",
      "pressing down upon the cities by the coasts; and he had \n",
      "taken now the title of King of Men, and declared his \n",
      "purpose to drive the Numenoreans into the sea, and \n",
      "destroy even Numenor, if that might be. \n",
      "\n",
      "Great was the anger of Ar-Pharazon at these tidings, \n",
      "and as he pondered long in secret, his heart was filled with \n",
      "the desire of power unbounded and the sole dominion of \n",
      "his will. And he determined without counsel of the Valar, or \n",
      "the aid of any wisdom but his own, that the title of King of \n",
      "Men he would himself claim, and would compel Sauron to \n",
      "become his vassal and his servant; for in his pride he \n",
      "deemed that no king should ever arise so mighty as to vie \n",
      "with the Heir of Earendil. Therefore he began in that time to \n",
      "smithy great hoard of weapons, and many ships of war he \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "built and stored them with his arms; and when all was made \n",
      "ready he himself set sail with his host into the East. \n",
      "\n",
      "And men saw his sails coming up out of the sunset, \n",
      "dyed as with scarlet and gleaming with red and gold, and \n",
      "fear fell upon the dwellers by the coasts, and they fled far \n",
      "away. But the fleet came at last to that place that was called \n",
      "Umbar, where was the mighty haven of the Numenoreans \n",
      "that no hand had wrought. Empty and silent were all the \n",
      "lands about when the King of the Sea marched upon \n",
      "Middle-earth. For seven days he journeyed with banner and \n",
      "trumpet, and he came to a hill, and he went up, and he set \n",
      "there his pavilion and his throne; and he sat him down in the \n",
      "midst of the land, and the tents of his host were ranged all \n",
      "about him, blue, golden, and white, as a field of tall flowers. \n",
      "Then he sent forth heralds, and he commanded Sauron to \n",
      "come before him and swear to him fealty. \n",
      "\n",
      "And Sauron came. Even from his mighty tower of \n",
      "Barad-dur he came, and made no offer of battle. For he \n",
      "perceived that the power and majesty of the Kings of the \n",
      "Sea surpassed all rumour of them, so that he could not trust \n",
      "even the greatest of his servants to withstand them; and he \n",
      "saw not his time yet to work his will with the Dunedain. And \n",
      "he was crafty, well skilled to gain what he would by subtlety \n",
      "when force might not avail. Therefore he humbled himself \n",
      "before Ar-Pharazon and smoothed his tongue; and men \n",
      "wondered, for all that he said seemed fair and wise. \n",
      "\n",
      "But Ar-Pharazon was not yet deceived, and it came \n",
      "into his mind that, for the better keeping of Sauron and of \n",
      "his oaths of fealty, he should be brought to Numenor, there \n",
      "to dwell as a hostage for himself and all his servants in \n",
      "Middle-earth. To this Sauron assented as one constrained, \n",
      "yet in his secret thought he received it gladly, for it chimed \n",
      "indeed with his desire. And Sauron passed over the sea \n",
      "and looked upon the land of Numenor, and on the city of \n",
      "Armenelos in the days of its glory, and he was astounded; \n",
      "but his heart within was filled the more with envy and hate. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yet such was the cunning of his mind and mouth, and \n",
      "the strength of his hidden will, that ere three years had \n",
      "passed he had become closest to the secret counsels of \n",
      "the King; for flattery sweet as honey was ever on his \n",
      "tongue, and knowledge he had of many things yet \n",
      "unrevealed to Men. And seeing the favour that he had of \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "their lord all the councillors began to fawn upon him, save \n",
      "one alone, Amandil lord of Andunie. Then slowly a change \n",
      "came over the land, and the hearts of the Elf-friends were \n",
      "sorely troubled, and many fell away out of fear; and although \n",
      "those that remained still called themselves the Faithful, their \n",
      "enemies named them rebels. For now, having the ears of \n",
      "men, Sauron with many arguments gainsaid all that the \n",
      "Valar had taught; and he bade men think that in the world, \n",
      "in the east and even hi the west, there lay yet many seas \n",
      "and many lands for their winning, wherein was wealth \n",
      "uncounted. And still, if they should at the last come to the \n",
      "end of those lands and seas, beyond all lay the Ancient \n",
      "Darkness. 'And out of it the world was made. For Darkness \n",
      "alone is worshipful, and the Lord thereof may yet make \n",
      "other worlds to be gifts to those that serve him, so that the \n",
      "increase of their power shall find no end.' \n",
      "\n",
      "And Ar-Pharazon said: 'Who is the Lord of the \n",
      "Darkness?' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then behind locked doors Sauron spoke to the King, \n",
      "and he lied, saying: 'It is he whose name is not now spoken; \n",
      "for the Valar have deceived you concerning him, putting \n",
      "forward the name of Eru, a phantom devised in the folly of \n",
      "their hearts, seeking to enchain Men in servitude to \n",
      "themselves. For they are the oracle of this Eru, which \n",
      "speaks only what they will. But he that is their master shall \n",
      "yet prevail, and he will deliver you from this phantom; and \n",
      "his name is Melkor, Lord of All, Giver of Freedom, and he \n",
      "shall make you stronger than they.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Ar-Pharazon the King turned back to the worship \n",
      "of the Dark, and of Melkor the Lord thereof, at first in secret, \n",
      "but ere long openly and in the face of his people; and they \n",
      "for the most part followed him. Yet there dwelt still a \n",
      "remnant of the Faithful, as has been told, at Romenna and \n",
      "in the country near, and other few there were here and there \n",
      "in the land. The chief among them, to whom they looked for \n",
      "leading and courage in evil days, was Amandil, councillor \n",
      "of the King, and his son Elendil, whose sons were Isildur \n",
      "and Anarion, then young men by the reckoning of Numenor. \n",
      "Amandil and Elendil were great ship-captains; and they \n",
      "were of the line of Elros Tar-Minyatur, though not of the \n",
      "ruling house to whom belonged the crown and the throne in \n",
      "the city of Armenelos. In the days of their youth together \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Amandil had been dear to Pharazon, and though he was of \n",
      "the Elf-friends he remained in his council until the coming of \n",
      "Sauron. Now he was dismissed, for Sauron hated him \n",
      "above all others in Numenor. But he was so noble, and had \n",
      "been so mighty a captain of the sea, that he was still held in \n",
      "honour by many of the people, and neither the King nor \n",
      "Sauron dared to lay hands on him as yet. \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore Amandil withdrew to Romenna, and all that \n",
      "he trusted still to be faithful he summoned to come thither in \n",
      "secret; for he feared that evil would now grow apace, and \n",
      "all the Elf-friends were in peril. And so it soon came to \n",
      "pass. For the Meneltarma was utterly deserted in those \n",
      "days; and though not even Sauron dared to defile the high \n",
      "place, yet the King would let no man, upon pain of death, \n",
      "ascend to it, not even those of the Faithful who kept lluvatar \n",
      "in their hearts. And Sauron urged the King to cut down the \n",
      "White Tree, Nimloth the Fair, that grew in his courts, for it \n",
      "was a memorial of the Eldar and of the light of Valinor. \n",
      "\n",
      "At the first the King would not assent to this, since be \n",
      "believed that the fortunes of his house were bound up with \n",
      "the Tree, as was forespoken by Tar-Palantir. Thus in his \n",
      "folly he who now hated the Eldar and the Valar vainly clung \n",
      "to the shadow of the old allegiance of Numenor. But when \n",
      "Amandil heard rumour of the evil purpose of Sauron he was \n",
      "grieved to the heart, knowing that in the end Sauron would \n",
      "surely have his will. Then he spoke to Elendil and the sons \n",
      "of Elendil, recalling the tale of the Trees of Valinor; and \n",
      "Isildur said no word, but went out by night and did a deed \n",
      "for which he was afterwards renowned. For he passed \n",
      "alone in disguise to Armenelos and to the courts of the \n",
      "King, which were now forbidden to the Faithful; and he \n",
      "came to the place of the Tree, which was forbidden to all by \n",
      "the orders of Sauron, and the Tree was watched day and \n",
      "night by guards in his service. At that time Nimloth was dark \n",
      "and bore no bloom, for it was late in the autumn, and its \n",
      "winter was nigh; and Isildur passed through the guards and \n",
      "took from the Tree a fruit that hung upon it, and turned to go. \n",
      "But the guard was aroused, and he was assailed, and \n",
      "fought his way out, receiving many wounds; and he \n",
      "escaped, and because he was disguised it was not \n",
      "discovered who had laid hands on the Tree. But Isildur \n",
      "came at last hardly back to Romenna and delivered the fruit \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "to the hands of Amandil, ere his strength failed him. Then \n",
      "the fruit was planted in secret, and it was blessed by \n",
      "Amandil; and a shoot arose from it and sprouted in the \n",
      "spring. But when its first leaf opened then Isildur, who had \n",
      "lain long and come near to death, arose and was troubled \n",
      "no more by his wounds. \n",
      "\n",
      "None too soon was this done; for after the assault the \n",
      "King yielded to Sauron and felled the White Tree, and \n",
      "turned then wholly away from the allegiance of his fathers. \n",
      "But Sauron caused to be built upon the hill in the midst of \n",
      "the city of the Numenoreans, Armenelos the Golden, a \n",
      "mighty temple; and it was in the form of a circle at the base, \n",
      "and there the walls were fifty feet in thickness, and the width \n",
      "of the base was five hundred feet across the centre, and \n",
      "the walls rose from the ground five hundred feet, and they \n",
      "were crowned with a mighty dome. And that dome was \n",
      "roofed all with silver, and rose glittering in the sun, so that \n",
      "the light of it could be seen afar off; but soon the light was \n",
      "darkened, and the silver became black. For there was an \n",
      "altar of fire in the midst of the temple, and in the topmost of \n",
      "the dome there was a louver, whence there issued a great \n",
      "smoke. And the first fire upon the altar Sauron kindled with \n",
      "the hewn wood of Nimloth, and it crackled and was \n",
      "consumed; but men marvelled at the reek that went up from \n",
      "it, so that the land lay under a cloud for seven days, until \n",
      "slowly it passed into the west. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thereafter the fire and smoke went up without ceasing; \n",
      "for the power of Sauron daily increased, and in that temple, \n",
      "with spilling of blood and torment and great wickedness, \n",
      "men made sacrifice to Melkor that he should release them \n",
      "from Death. And most often from among the Faithful they \n",
      "chose their victims; yet never openly on the charge that they \n",
      "would not worship Melkor, the Giver of Freedom, rather \n",
      "was cause sought against them that they hated the King \n",
      "and were his rebels, or that they plotted against their kin, \n",
      "devising lies and poisons. These charges were for the \n",
      "most part false; yet those were bitter days, and hate brings \n",
      "forth hate. \n",
      "\n",
      "But for all this Death did not depart from the land, \n",
      "rather it came sooner and more often, and in many dreadful \n",
      "guises. For whereas aforetime men had grown slowly old, \n",
      "and had laid them down in the end to sleep, when they were \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "weary at last of the world, now madness and sickness \n",
      "assailed them; and yet they were afraid to die and go out \n",
      "into the dark, the realm of the lord that they had taken; and \n",
      "they cursed themselves in their agony. And men took \n",
      "weapons in those days and slew one another for little \n",
      "cause; for they were become quick to anger, and Sauron, \n",
      "or those whom he had bound to himself, went about the \n",
      "land setting man against man, so that the people murmured \n",
      "against the King and the lords, or against any that had \n",
      "aught that they had not; and the men of power took cruel \n",
      "revenge. \n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless for long it seemed to the Numenoreans \n",
      "that they prospered, and if they were not increased in \n",
      "happiness, yet they grew more strong, and their rich men \n",
      "ever richer. For with the aid and counsel of Sauron they \n",
      "multiplied then: possessions, and they devised engines, \n",
      "and they built ever greater ships. And they sailed now with \n",
      "power and armoury to Middle-earth, and they came no \n",
      "longer as bringers of gifts, nor even as rulers, but as fierce \n",
      "men of war. And they hunted the men of Middle-earth and \n",
      "took their goods and enslaved them, and many they slew \n",
      "cruelly upon their altars. For they built in their fortresses \n",
      "temples and great tombs in those days; and men feared \n",
      "them, and the memory of the kindly kings of the ancient \n",
      "days faded from the world and was darkened by many a \n",
      "tale of dread. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus Ar-Pharazon, King of the Land of the Star, grew \n",
      "to the mightiest tyrant that had yet been in the world since \n",
      "the reign of Morgoth, though in truth Sauron ruled all from \n",
      "behind the throne. But the years passed, and the King felt \n",
      "the shadow of death approach, as his days lengthened; \n",
      "and he was filled with fear and wrath. Now came the hour \n",
      "that Sauron had prepared and long had awaited. And \n",
      "Sauron spoke to the King, saying that his strength was now \n",
      "so great that he might think to have his will in all things, and \n",
      "be subject to no command or ban. \n",
      "\n",
      "And he said: The Valar have possessed themselves \n",
      "of the land where there is no death; and they lie to you \n",
      "concerning it, hiding it as best they may, because of their \n",
      "avarice, and their fear lest the Kings of Men should wrest \n",
      "from them the deathless realm and rule the world in their \n",
      "stead. And though, doubtless, the gift of life unending is not \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "for all, but only for such as are worthy, being men of might \n",
      "and pride and great lineage, yet against all Justice is it \n",
      "done that this gift, which is his due, should be withheld from \n",
      "the King of Bangs, Ar-Pharazon, mightiest of the sons of \n",
      "Earth, to whom Manwe alone can be compared, if even he. \n",
      "But great kings do not brook denials, and take what is their \n",
      "due.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Ar-Pharazon, being besotted, and walking under \n",
      "the shadow of death, for his span was drawing towards its \n",
      "end, hearkened to Sauron; and he began to ponder in his \n",
      "heart how he might make war upon the Valar. He was long \n",
      "preparing this design, and he spoke not openly of it, yet it \n",
      "could not be hidden from all. And Amandil, becoming \n",
      "aware of the purposes of the King, was dismayed and filled \n",
      "with a great dread, for he knew that Men could not vanquish \n",
      "the Valar in war, and that ruin must come upon the world, if \n",
      "this war were not stayed. Therefore he called his son, \n",
      "Elendil, and he said to him: \n",
      "\n",
      "The days are dark, and there is no hope for Men, for \n",
      "the Faithful are few. Therefore I am minded to try that \n",
      "counsel which our forefather Earendil took of old, to sail into \n",
      "the West, be there ban or no, and to speak to the Valar, \n",
      "even to Manwe himself, if may be, and beseech his aid ere \n",
      "all is lost.' \n",
      "\n",
      "'Would you then betray the King?' said Elendil. 'For you \n",
      "know well the charge that they make against us, that we are \n",
      "traitors and spies, and that until this day it has been false.' \n",
      "\n",
      "'If I thought that Manwe needed such a messenger,' \n",
      "said Amandil, I would betray the King. For there is but one \n",
      "loyalty from which no man can be absolved in heart for any \n",
      "cause. But it is for mercy upon Men and their deliverance \n",
      "from Sauron the Deceiver that I would plead, since some at \n",
      "least have remained faithful. And as for the Ban, I will suffer \n",
      "in myself the penalty, lest all my people should become \n",
      "guilty.' \n",
      "\n",
      "'But what think you, my father, is like to befall those of \n",
      "your house whom you leave behind, when your deed \n",
      "becomes known?' \n",
      "\n",
      "'It must not become known,' said Amandil. 'I will \n",
      "prepare my going in secret, and I will set sail into the east, \n",
      "whither daily the ships depart from our havens; and \n",
      "thereafter, as wind and chance may allow, I will go about, \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "through south or north, back into the west, and seek what I \n",
      "may find. But for you and your folk, my son, I counsel that \n",
      "you should prepare yourselves other ships, and put aboard \n",
      "all such things as your hearts cannot bear to part with; and \n",
      "when the ships are ready, you should lie in the haven of \n",
      "Romenna, and give out among men that you purpose, when \n",
      "you see your time, to follow me into the east. Amandil is no \n",
      "longer so dear to our kinsman upon the throne that he will \n",
      "grieve over much, if we seek to depart, for a season or for \n",
      "good. But let it not be seen that you intend to take many \n",
      "men, or he will be troubled, because of the war that he now \n",
      "plots, for which he will need all the force that he may gather. \n",
      "Seek out the Faithful that are known still to be true, and let \n",
      "them join you in secret, if they are willing to go with you, and \n",
      "share in your design.' \n",
      "\n",
      "'And what shall that design be?' said Elendil. \n",
      "\n",
      "'To meddle not in the war, and to watch,' answered \n",
      "Amandil. 'Until I return I can say no more. But it is most like \n",
      "that you shall fly from the Land of the Star with no star to \n",
      "guide you; for that land is defiled. Then you shall lose all that \n",
      "you have loved, foretasting death in life, seeking a land of \n",
      "exile elsewhere. But east or west the Valar alone can say.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Amandil said farewell to all his household, as one \n",
      "that is about to die. 'For,' said he, 'it may well prove that you \n",
      "will see me never again; and that I shall show you no such \n",
      "sign as Earendil showed long ago. But hold you ever in \n",
      "readiness, for the end of the world that we have known is \n",
      "now at hand.' \n",
      "\n",
      "It is said that Amandil set sail in a small ship at night, \n",
      "and steered first eastward, and then went about and \n",
      "passed into the west. And he took with him three servants, \n",
      "dear to his heart, and never again were they heard of by \n",
      "word or sign in this world, nor is there any tale or guess of \n",
      "their fate. Men could not a second time be saved by any \n",
      "such embassy, and for the treason of Numenor there was \n",
      "no easy absolving. \n",
      "\n",
      "But Elendil did all that his father had bidden, and his \n",
      "ships lay off the east coast of the land; and the Faithful put \n",
      "aboard their wives and their children, and their heirlooms, \n",
      "and great store of goods. Many things there were of beauty \n",
      "and power, such as the Numenoreans had contrived in the \n",
      "days of their wisdom, vessels and jewels, and scrolls of lore \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "written in scarlet and black. And Seven Stones they had, \n",
      "the gift of the Eldar; but in the ship of Isildur was guarded \n",
      "the young tree, the scion of Nimloth the Fair. Thus Elendil \n",
      "held himself in readiness, and did not meddle in the evil \n",
      "deeds of those days; and ever he looked for a sign that did \n",
      "not come. Then he journeyed in secret to the western \n",
      "shores and gazed out over the sea, for sorrow and yearning \n",
      "were upon him, and he greatly loved his father. But naught \n",
      "could he descry save the fleets of Ar-Pharazon gathering in \n",
      "the havens of the west. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now aforetime in the isle of Numenor the weather was \n",
      "ever apt to the needs and liking of Men: rain in due season \n",
      "and ever in measure; and sunshine, now warmer, now \n",
      "cooler, and winds from the sea. And when the wind was in \n",
      "the west, it seemed to many that it was filled with a \n",
      "fragrance, fleeting but sweet, heart-stirring, as of flowers \n",
      "that bloom for ever in undying meads and have no names \n",
      "on mortal shores. But all this was now changed; for the sky \n",
      "itself was darkened, and there were storms of rain and hail \n",
      "in those days, and violent winds; and ever and anon a great \n",
      "ship of the Numenoreans would founder and return not to \n",
      "haven, though such a grief had not till then befallen them \n",
      "since the rising of the Star. And out of the west there would \n",
      "come at times a great cloud in the evening, shaped as it \n",
      "were an eagle, with pinions spread to the north and the \n",
      "south; and slowly it would loom up, blotting out the sunset, \n",
      "and then uttermost night would fall upon Numenor. And \n",
      "some of the eagles bore lightning beneath their wings, and \n",
      "thunder echoed between sea and cloud. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then men grew afraid. 'Behold the Eagles of the Lords \n",
      "of the West!' they cried. 'The Eagles of Manwe are come \n",
      "upon Numenor!' And they fell upon their faces. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then some few would repent for a season, but others \n",
      "hardened their hearts, and they shook their fists at heaven, \n",
      "saying: 'The Lords of the West have plotted against us. \n",
      "They strike first. The next blow shall be ours!' These words \n",
      "the King himself spoke, but they were devised bySauron. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now the lightnings increased and slew men upon the \n",
      "hills, and in the fields, and in the streets of the city; and a \n",
      "fiery bolt smote the dome of the Temple and shore it \n",
      "asunder, and it was wreathed in flame. But the Temple itself \n",
      "was unshaken, and Sauron stood there upon the pinnacle \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "and defied the lightning and was unharmed; and in that hour \n",
      "men called him a god and did all that he would. When \n",
      "therefore the last portent came they heeded it little. For the \n",
      "land shook under them, and a groaning as of thunder \n",
      "underground was mingled with the roaring of the sea, and \n",
      "smoke issued from the peak of the Meneltarma. But all the \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In that time the fleets of the Numenoreans darkened \n",
      "the sea upon the west of the land, and they were like an \n",
      "archipelago of a thousand isles; their masts were as a \n",
      "forest upon the mountains, and their sails like a brooding \n",
      "cloud; and their banners were golden and black. And all \n",
      "things waited upon the word of Ar-Pharazon; and Sauron \n",
      "withdrew into the inmost circle of the Temple, and men \n",
      "brought him victims to be burned. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Eagles of the Lords of the West came up out \n",
      "of the dayfall, and they were arrayed as for battle, \n",
      "advancing in a line the end of which diminished beyond \n",
      "sight; and as they came their wings spread ever wider, \n",
      "grasping the sky. But the West burned red behind them, \n",
      "and they glowed beneath, as though they were lit with a \n",
      "flame of great anger, so that all Numenor was illumined as \n",
      "with a smouldering fire; and men looked upon the faces of \n",
      "their fellows, and it seemed to them that they were red with \n",
      "wrath. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Ar-Pharazon hardened his heart, and he went \n",
      "aboard his mighty ship, Alcarondas, Castle of the Sea. \n",
      "Many-oared it was and many-masted, golden and sable; \n",
      "and upon it the throne of Ar-Pharazon was set. Then he did \n",
      "on his panoply and his crown, and let raise his standard, \n",
      "and he gave the signal for the raising of the anchors; and in \n",
      "that hour the trumpets of Numenor outrang the thunder. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus the fleets of the Numenoreans moved against the \n",
      "menace of the West; and there was little wind, but they had \n",
      "many oars and many strong slaves to row beneath the lash. \n",
      "The sun went down, and there came a great silence. \n",
      "Darkness fell upon the land, and the sea was still, while the \n",
      "world waited for what should betide. Slowly the fleets \n",
      "passed out of the sight of the watchers in the havens, and \n",
      "their lights faded, and night took them; and in the morning \n",
      "they were gone. For a wind arose in the east and it wafted \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "them away; and they broke the Ban of the Valar, and sailed \n",
      "into forbidden seas, going up with war against the \n",
      "Deathless, to wrest from them everlasting life within the \n",
      "Circles of the World. \n",
      "\n",
      "But the fleets of Ar-Pharazon came up out of the deeps \n",
      "of the sea and encompassed Avallone and all the isle of \n",
      "Eressea, and the Eldar mourned, for the light of the setting \n",
      "sun was cut off by the cloud of the Numenoreans. And at \n",
      "last Ar-Pharazon came even to Aman, the Blessed Realm, \n",
      "and the coasts of Valinor; and still all was silent, and doom \n",
      "hung by a thread. For Ar-Pharazon wavered at the end, and \n",
      "almost he turned back. His heart misgave him when he \n",
      "looked upon the soundless shores and saw Taniquetil \n",
      "shining, whiter than snow, colder than death, silent, \n",
      "immutable, terrible as the shadow of the light of lluvatar. But \n",
      "pride was now his master, and at last he left his ship and \n",
      "strode upon the shore, claiming the land for his own, if none \n",
      "should do battle for it. And a host of the Numenoreans \n",
      "encamped in might about Tuna, whence all the Eldar had \n",
      "fled. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Manwe upon the Mountain called upon lluvatar, \n",
      "and for that time the Valar laid down their government of \n",
      "Arda. But lluvatar showed forth his power, and he changed \n",
      "the fashion of the world; and a great chasm opened in the \n",
      "sea between Numenor and the Deathless Lands, and the \n",
      "waters flowed down into it, and the noise and smoke of the \n",
      "cataracts went up to heaven, and the world was shaken. \n",
      "And all the fleets of the Numenoreans were drawn down \n",
      "into the abyss, and they were drowned and swallowed up \n",
      "for ever. But Ar-Pharazon the King and the mortal warriors \n",
      "that had set foot upon the land of Aman were buried under \n",
      "falling hills: there it is said that they lie imprisoned in the \n",
      "Caves of the Forgotten, until the Last Battle and the Day of \n",
      "Doom. \n",
      "\n",
      "But the land of Aman and Eressea of the Eldar were \n",
      "taken away and removed beyond the reach of Men for ever. \n",
      "And Andor, the Land of Gift, Numenor of the Kings, Elenna \n",
      "of the Star of Earendil, was utterly destroyed. For it was \n",
      "nigh to the east of the great rift, and its foundations were \n",
      "overturned, and it fell and went down into darkness, and is \n",
      "no more. And there is not now upon Earth any place \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "abiding where the memory of a time without evil is \n",
      "preserved. For lluvatar cast back the Great Seas west of \n",

      "Of old there was Sauron the Maia, whom the Sindar in \n",

      "seduced him to his allegiance, and he became the greatest \n",

      "When Thangorodrim was broken and Morgoth \n",
      "overthrown, Sauron put on his fair hue again and did \n",
      "obeisance to Eonwe the herald of Manwe, and abjured all \n",
      "his evil deeds. And some hold that this was not at first \n",
      "falsely done, but that Sauron in truth repented, if only out of \n",
      "fear, being dismayed by the fall of Morgoth and the great \n",
      "wrath of the Lords of the West. But it was not within the \n",
      "power of Eonwe to pardon those of his own order, and he \n",
      "commanded Sauron to return to Aman and there receive \n",
      "the judgement of Manwe. Then Sauron was ashamed, and \n",
      "he was unwilling to return in humiliation and to receive from \n",
      "the Valar a sentence, it might be, of long servitude in proof \n",
      "of his good faith; for under Morgoth his power had been \n",
      "great. Therefore when Eonwe departed he hid himself in \n",
      "Middle-earth; and he fell back into evil, for the bonds that \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Great Battle and the tumults of the fall of \n",

      "and Beleriand was broken and laid waste; and northward \n",
      "and westward many lands sank beneath the waters of the \n",
      "Great Sea. In the east, in Ossiriand, the walls of Ered Luin \n",
      "were broken, and a great gap was made in them towards \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the Gulf of Lhun. That country had of old been named \n",
      "Lindon by the Noldor, and this name it bore thereafter; and \n",
      "many of the Eldar still dwelt there, lingering, unwilling yet to \n",
      "forsake Beleriand where they had fought and laboured \n",
      "long. Gil-galad son of Fingon was their king, and with him \n",

      "\n",
      "Upon the shores of the Gulf of Lhun the Elves built their \n",

      "many ships, for the harbourage was good. From the Grey \n",
      "Havens the Eldar ever and anon set sail, fleeing from the \n",

      "beyond the encircling seas. \n",
      "\n",
      "Others of the Eldar there were who crossed the \n",
      "mountains of Ered Luin in that age and passed into the \n",
      "inner lands. Many of these were Teleri, survivors of Doriath \n",
      "and Ossiriand; and they established realms among the \n",
      "Silvan Elves in woods and mountains far from the sea, for \n",
      "which nonetheless they ever yearned in their hearts. Only in \n",
      "Eregion, which Men called Hollin, did Elves of Noldorin \n",
      "race establish a lasting realm beyond the Ered Luin. \n",
      "Eregion was nigh to the great mansions of the Dwarves \n",
      "that were named Khazad-dum, but by the Elves \n",
      "Hadhodrond, and afterwards Moria. From Ost-in-Edhil, the \n",
      "city of the Elves, the highroad ran to the west gate of \n",
      "Khazad-dum, for a friendship arose between Dwarves and \n",
      "Elves, such as has never elsewhere been, to the \n",
      "enrichment of both those peoples. In Eregion the craftsmen \n",
      "of the Gwaith-i-Mirdain, the People of the Jewel-smiths, \n",
      "surpassed in cunning all that have ever wrought, save only \n",
      "Feanor himself; and indeed greatest in skill among them \n",
      "was Celebrimbor, son of Curufin, who was estranged from \n",

      "Silmarillion. \n",
      "\n",
      "Elsewhere in Middle-earth there was peace for many \n",
      "years; yet the lands were for the most part savage and \n",
      "desolate, save only where the people of Beleriand came. \n",
      "Many Elves dwelt there indeed, as they had dwelt through \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the countless years, wandering free in the wide lands far \n",
      "from the Sea; but they were Avari, to whom the deeds of \n",
      "Beleriand were but a rumour and Valinor only a distant \n",
      "name. And in the south and in the further east Men \n",
      "multiplied; and most of them turned to evil, for Sauron was \n",
      "at work. \n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing the desolation of the world, Sauron said in his \n",
      "heart that the Valar, having overthrown Morgoth, had again \n",
      "forgotten Middle-earth; and his pride grew apace. He \n",
      "looked with hatred on the Eldar, and he feared the Men of \n",
      "Numenor who came back at whiles in their ships to the \n",
      "shores of Middle-earth; but for long he dissembled his mind \n",
      "and concealed the dark designs that he shaped in his \n",
      "heart. \n",
      "\n",
      "Men he found the easiest to sway of all the peoples of \n",
      "the Earth; but long he sought to persuade the Elves to his \n",
      "service, for he knew that the Firstborn had the greater \n",
      "power; and he went far and wide among them, and his hue \n",
      "was still that of one both fair and wise. Only to Lindon he \n",
      "did not come, for Gil-galad and Elrond doubted him and his \n",
      "fair-seeming, and though they knew not who in truth he was \n",
      "they would not admit him to that land. But elsewhere the \n",
      "Elves received him gladly, and few among them hearkened \n",
      "to the messengers from Lindon bidding them beware; for \n",
      "Sauron took to himself the name of Annatar, the Lord of \n",
      "Gifts, and they had at first much profit from his friendship. \n",
      "And he said to them: \"Alas, for the weakness of the great! \n",
      "For a mighty king is Gil-galad, and wise in all lore is Master \n",
      "Elrond, and yet they will not aid me in my labours. Can it be \n",
      "that they do not desire to see other lands become as \n",
      "blissful as their own? But wherefore should Middle-earth \n",
      "remain for ever desolate and dark, whereas the Elves could \n",
      "make it as fair as Eressea, nay even as Valinor? And since \n",
      "you have not returned thither, as you might, I perceive that \n",
      "you love this Middle-earth, as do I. Is it not then our task to \n",
      "labour together for its enrichment, and for the raising of all \n",
      "the Elven-kindreds that wander here untaught to the height \n",
      "of that power and knowledge which those have who are \n",
      "beyond the Sea?' \n",
      "\n",
      "It was in Eregion that the counsels of Sauron were \n",
      "most gladly received, for in that land the Noldor desired \n",
      "ever to increase the skill and subtlety of their works. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover they were not at peace in their hearts, since they \n",
      "had refused to return into the West, and they desired both \n",
      "to stay in Middle-earth, which indeed they loved, and yet to \n",
      "enjoy the bliss of those that had departed. Therefore they \n",
      "hearkened to Sauron, and they learned of him many things, \n",
      "for his knowledge was great. In those days the smiths of \n",
      "Ost-in-Edhil surpassed all that they had contrived before; \n",
      "and they took thought, and they made Rings of Power. But \n",
      "Sauron guided their labours, and he was aware of all that \n",
      "they did; for his desire was to set a bond upon the Elves \n",
      "and to bring them under his vigilance. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now the Elves made many rings; but secretly Sauron \n",
      "made One Ring to rule all the others, and their power was \n",
      "bound up with it, to be subject wholly to it and to last only so \n",
      "long as it too should last. And much of the strength and will \n",
      "of Sauron passed into that One Ring; for the power of the \n",
      "Elverwings was very great, and that which should govern \n",
      "them must be a thing of surpassing potency; and Sauron \n",
      "forged it in the Mountain of Fire in the Land of Shadow. And \n",
      "while he wore the One Ring he could perceive all the things \n",
      "that were done by means of the lesser rings, and he could \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "But the Elves were not so lightly to be caught. As soon \n",
      "as Sauron set the One Ring upon his finger they were \n",
      "aware of him; and they knew him, and perceived that he \n",
      "would be master of them, and of an that they wrought. Then \n",
      "in anger and fear they took off their rings. But he, finding \n",
      "that he was betrayed and that the Elves were not deceived, \n",
      "was filled with wrath; and he came against them with open \n",
      "war, demanding that all the rings should be delivered to \n",
      "him, since the Elven-smiths could not have attained to their \n",
      "making without his lore and counsel. But the Elves fled from \n",
      "him; and three of their rings they saved, and bore them \n",
      "away, and hid them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now these were the Three that had last been made, \n",
      "and they possessed the greatest powers. Narya, Nenya, \n",
      "and Vilya, they were named, the Rings of Fire, and of \n",
      "Water, and of Air, set with ruby and adamant and sapphire; \n",
      "and of all the Elven-rings Sauron most desired to possess \n",
      "them, for those who had them in their keeping could ward \n",
      "off the decays of time and postpone the weariness of the \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "world. But Sauron could not discover them, for they were \n",
      "given into the hands of the Wise, who concealed them and \n",
      "never again used them openly while Sauron kept the Ruling \n",
      "Ring. Therefore the Three remained unsullied, for they were \n",
      "forged by Celebrimbor alone, and the hand of Sauron had \n",
      "never touched them; yet they also were subject to the One. \n",
      "\n",
      "From that time war never ceased between Sauron and \n",
      "the Elves; and Eregion was laid waste, and Celebrimbor \n",
      "slain, and the doors of Moria were shut. In that time the \n",
      "stronghold and refuge of Imladris, that Men called Rivendell, \n",
      "was founded by Elrond Half-elven; and long it endured. But \n",
      "Sauron gathered into his hands all the remaining Rings of \n",
      "Power; and he dealt them out to the other peoples of \n",
      "Middle-earth, hoping thus to bring under his sway all those \n",
      "that desired secret power beyond the measure of their \n",
      "kind. Seven Rings he gave to the Dwarves; but to Men he \n",
      "gave nine, for Men proved in this matter as in others the \n",
      "readiest to his will. And all those rings that he governed he \n",
      "perverted, the more easily since he had a part in their \n",
      "making, and they were accursed, and they betrayed in the \n",
      "end all those that used them. The Dwarves indeed proved \n",
      "tough and hard to tame; they ill endure the domination of \n",
      "others, and the thoughts of their hearts are hard to fathom, \n",
      "nor can they be turned to shadows. They used their rings \n",
      "only for the getting of wealth; but wrath and an over- \n",
      "mastering greed of gold were kindled in their hearts, of \n",
      "which evil enough after came to the profit of Sauron. It is \n",
      "said that the foundation of each of the Seven Hoards of the \n",
      "Dwarf-kings of old was a golden ring; but all those hoards \n",
      "long ago were plundered and the Dragons devoured them, \n",
      "and of the Seven Rings some were consumed in fire and \n",
      "some Sauron recovered. \n",
      "\n",
      "Men proved easier to ensnare. Those who used the \n",
      "Nine Rings became mighty in their day, kings, sorcerers, \n",
      "and warriors of old. They obtained glory and great wealth, \n",
      "yet it turned to their undoing. They had, as it seemed, \n",
      "unending life, yet life became unendurable to them. They \n",
      "could walk, if they would, unseen by all eyes in this world \n",
      "beneath the sun, and they could see things in worlds \n",
      "invisible to mortal men; but too often they beheld only the \n",
      "phantoms and delusions of Sauron. And one by one, \n",
      "sooner or later, according to their native strength and to the \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "good or evil of their wills in the beginning, they fell under the \n",
      "thraldom of the ring that they bore and under the domination \n",
      "of the One, which was Sauron's. And they became for ever \n",
      "invisible save to him that wore the Ruling Ring, and they \n",
      "entered into the realm of shadows. The Nazgul were they, \n",
      "the Ringwraiths, the Enemy's most terrible servants; \n",
      "darkness went with them, and they cried with the voices of \n",
      "death. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now Sauron's lust and pride increased, until he knew \n",
      "no bounds, and he determined to make himself master of \n",
      "all things in Middle-earth, and to destroy the Elves, and to \n",
      "compass, if he might, the downfall of Numenor. He brooked \n",
      "no freedom nor any rivalry, and he named himself Lord of \n",
      "the Earth. A mask he still could wear so that if he wished he \n",
      "might deceive the eyes of Men, seeming to them wise and \n",
      "fair. But he ruled rather by force and fear, if they might avail; \n",
      "and those who perceived his shadow spreading over the \n",
      "world called him the Dark Lord and named him the Enemy; \n",
      "and he gathered again under his government all the evil \n",
      "things of the days of Morgoth that remained on earth or \n",
      "beneath it, and the Ores were at his command and \n",
      "multiplied like flies. Thus the Black Years began, which the \n",
      "Elves call the Days of Flight. In that time many of the Elves \n",
      "of Middle-earth fled to Lindon and thence over the seas \n",
      "never to return; and many were destroyed by Sauron and \n",
      "his servants. But in Lindon Gil-galad still maintained his \n",
      "power, and Sauron dared not as yet to pass the Mountains \n",
      "of Ered Luin nor to assail the Havens; and Gil-galad was \n",
      "aided by the Numenoreans. Elsewhere Sauron reigned, \n",
      "and those who would be free took refuge in the fastnesses \n",
      "of wood and mountain, and ever fear pursued them. In the \n",
      "east and south well nigh all Men were under his dominion, \n",
      "and they grew strong in those days and built many towns \n",
      "and walls of stone, and they were numerous and fierce in \n",
      "war and aimed with iron. To them Sauron was both king \n",
      "and god; and they feared him exceedingly, for he \n",
      "surrounded his abode with fire. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yet there came at length a stay in the onslaught of \n",
      "Sauron upon the westlands. For, as is told in tile \n",
      "Akallabeth, he was challenged by the might of Numenor. \n",
      "So great was the power and splendour of the \n",
      "Numenoreans in the noontide of their realm that the \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "servants of Sauron would not withstand them, and hoping to \n",
      "accomplish by cunning what he could not achieve by force, \n",
      "he left Middle-earth for a while and went to Numenor as a \n",
      "hostage of Tar-Calion the King. And there he abode, until at \n",
      "the last by his craft he had corrupted the hearts of most of \n",
      "that people, and set them at war with the Valar, and so \n",
      "compassed their ruin, as he had long desired. But that ruin \n",
      "was more terrible than Sauron had foreseen, for he had \n",
      "forgotten the might of the Lords of the West in their anger. \n",
      "The world was broken, and the land was swallowed up, and \n",
      "the seas rose over it, and Sauron himself went down into \n",
      "the abyss. But his spirit arose and fled back on a dark wind \n",
      "to Middle-earth, seeking a home. There he found that the \n",
      "power of Gil-galad had grown great in the years of his \n",
      "absence, and it was spread now over wide regions of the \n",
      "north and west, and had passed beyond the Misty \n",
      "Mountains and the Great River even to the borders of \n",
      "Greenwood the Great, and was drawing nigh to the strong \n",
      "places where once he had dwelt secure. Then Sauron \n",
      "withdrew to his fortress in the Black Land and meditated \n",
      "war. \n",
      "\n",
      "In that time those of the Numenoreans who were saved \n",
      "from destruction fled eastward, as is told in the Akallabeth. \n",
      "The chief of these were Elendil the Tall and his sons, Isildur \n",
      "and Anarion. Kinsmen of the King they were, descendants \n",
      "of Elros, but they had been unwilling to listen to Sauron, and \n",
      "had refused to make war on the Lords of the West. \n",
      "Manning their ships with all who remained faithful they \n",
      "forsook the land of Numenor ere ruin came upon it. They \n",
      "were mighty men and their ships were strong and tall, but \n",
      "the tempests overtook them, and they were borne aloft on \n",
      "hills of water even to the clouds, and they descended upon \n",
      "Middle-earth like birds of the storm. \n",
      "\n",
      "Elendil was cast up by the waves in the land of Lindon, \n",
      "and he was befriended by Gil-galad. Thence he passed up \n",
      "the River Lhun, and beyond Ered Luin he established his \n",
      "realm, and his people dwelt in many places in Eriador \n",
      "about the courses of the Lhun and the Baranduin; but his \n",
      "chief city was at Annuminas beside the water of Lake \n",
      "Nenuial. At Fornost upon the North Downs also the \n",
      "Numenoreans dwelt, and in Cardolan, and in the hills of \n",
      "Rhudaur; and towers they raised upon Emyn Beraid and \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "upon Amon Sul; and there remain many barrows and ruined \n",
      "works in those places, but the towers of Emyn Beraid still \n",
      "look towards the sea. \n",
      "\n",
      "Isildur and Anarion were borne away southwards, and \n",
      "at the last they brought their ships up the Great River \n",
      "Anduin, that flows out of Rhovanion into the western sea in \n",
      "the Bay of Belfalas; and they established a realm in those \n",
      "lands that were after called Gondor, whereas the Northern \n",
      "Kingdom was named Arnor. Long before in the days of \n",
      "their power the mariners of Numenor had established a \n",
      "haven and strong places about the mouths of Anduin, in \n",
      "despite of Sauron in the Black Land that lay nigh upon the \n",
      "east. In the later days to this haven came only the Faithful of \n",
      "Numenor, and many therefore of the folk of the coastlands \n",
      "in that region were in whole or in part akin to the Elf-friends \n",
      "and the people of Elendil, and they welcomed his sons. The \n",
      "chief city of this southern realm was Osgiliath, through the \n",
      "midst of which the Great River flowed; and the \n",
      "Numenoreans built there a great bridge, upon which there \n",
      "were towers and houses of stone wonderful to behold, and \n",
      "tall ships came up out of the sea to the quays of the city. \n",
      "Other strong places they built also upon either hand: Minas \n",
      "Ithil, the Tower of the Rising Moon, eastward upon a \n",
      "shoulder of the Mountains of Shadow as a threat to Mordor; \n",
      "and to the westward Minas Anor, the Tower of the Setting \n",
      "Sun, at the feet of Mount Mindolluin, as a shield against the \n",
      "wild men of the dales. In Minas Ithil was the house of Isildur, \n",
      "and in Minas Anor the house of Anarion, but they shared \n",
      "the realm between them and their thrones were set side by \n",
      "side in the Great Hall of Osgiliath. These were the chief \n",
      "dwellings of the Numenoreans in Gondor, but other works \n",
      "marvellous and strong they built in the land in the days of \n",
      "their power, at the Argonath, and at Aglarond, and at Erech; \n",
      "and in the circle of Angrenost, which Men called Isengard, \n",
      "they made the Pinnacle of Orthanc of unbreakable stone. \n",
      "\n",
      "Many treasures and great heirlooms of virtue and \n",
      "wonder the Exiles had brought from Numenor; and of these \n",
      "the most renowned were the Seven Stones and the White \n",
      "Tree. The White Tree was grown from the fruit of Nimloth \n",
      "the Fair that stood in the courts of the Bang at Armenelos in \n",
      "Numenor, ere Sauron burned it; and Nimloth was in its turn \n",
      "descended from the Tree of Tlrion, that was an image of \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the Eldest of Trees, White Telperion which Yavanna caused \n",
      "to grow in the land of the Valar. The Tree, memorial of the \n",
      "Eldar and of the light of Valinor, was planted in Minas Ithil \n",
      "before the house of Isildur, since he it was that had saved \n",
      "the fruit from destruction; but the Stones were divided. \n",
      "\n",
      "Three Elendil took, and his sons each two. Those of \n",
      "Elendil were set in towers upon Emyn Beraid, and upon \n",
      "Amon Sul, and in the city of Annuminas. But those of his \n",
      "sons were at Minas Ithil and Minas Anor, and at Orthanc \n",
      "and in Osgiliath. Now these Stones had this virtue that \n",
      "those who looked therein might perceive in them things far \n",
      "off, whether in place or in time. For the most part they \n",
      "revealed only things near to another kindred Stone, for the \n",
      "Stones each called to each; but those who possessed \n",
      "great strength of will and of mind might learn to direct their \n",
      "gaze whither they would. Thus the Numenoreans were \n",
      "aware of many things that their enemies wished to conceal, \n",
      "and little escaped their vigilance in the days of their might. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is said that the towers of Emyn Beraid were not built \n",
      "indeed by the Exiles of Numenor, but were raised by Gil- \n",
      "galad for Elendil, his friend; and the Seeing Stone of Emyn \n",
      "Beraid was set in Elostirion, the tallest of the towers. \n",
      "Thither Elendil would repair, and thence he would gaze out \n",
      "over the sundering seas, when the yearning of exile was \n",
      "upon him; and it is believed that thus he would at whiles see \n",
      "far away even the Tower of Avallone upon Eressea, where \n",
      "the Masterstone abode, and yet abides. These stones \n",
      "were gifts of the Eldar to Amandil, father of Elendil, for the \n",
      "comfort of the Faithful of Numenor in their dark days, when \n",
      "the Elves might come no longer to that land under the \n",
      "shadow of Sauron. They were called the Palantlri, those \n",
      "that watch from afar; but all those that were brought to \n",
      "Middle-earth long ago were lost. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus the Exiles of Numenor established their realms in \n",
      "Amor and in Gondor; but ere many years had passed it \n",
      "became manifest that their enemy, Sauron, had also \n",
      "returned. He came in secret, as has been told, to his \n",
      "ancient kingdom of Mordor beyond the Ephel Duath, the \n",
      "Mountains of Shadow, and that country marched with \n",
      "Gondor upon the east. There above the valley of Gorgoroth \n",
      "was built his fortress vast and strong, Barad-dur, the Dark \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Tower; and there was a fiery mountain in that land that the \n",
      "Elves named Orodruin. Indeed for that reason Sauron had \n",
      "set there his dwelling long before, for he used the fire that \n",
      "welled there from the heart of the earth in his sorceries and \n",
      "in his forging; and in the midst of the Land of Mordor he had \n",
      "fashioned the Ruling Ring. There now he brooded in the \n",
      "dark, until he had wrought for himself a new shape; and it \n",
      "was terrible, for his fair semblance had departed for ever \n",
      "when he was cast into the abyss at the drowning of \n",
      "Numenor. He took up again the great Ring and clothed \n",
      "himself in power; and the malice of the Eye of Sauron few \n",
      "even of the great among Elves and Men could endure. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now Sauron prepared war against the Eldar and the \n",
      "Men of Westernesse, and the fires of the Mountain were \n",
      "wakened again. Wherefore seeing the smoke of Orodruin \n",
      "from afar, and perceiving that Sauron had returned, the \n",
      "Numenoreans named that mountain anew Amon Amarth, \n",
      "which is Mount Doom. And Sauron gathered to him great \n",
      "strength of his servants out of the east and the south; and \n",
      "among them were not a few of the high race of Numenor. \n",
      "For in the days of the sojourn of Sauron in that land the \n",
      "hearts of well nigh all its people had been turned towards \n",
      "darkness. Therefore many of those who sailed east in that \n",
      "time and made fortresses and dwellings upon the coasts \n",
      "were already bent to his will, and they served him still gladly \n",
      "in Middle-earth. But because of the power of Gil-galad \n",
      "these renegades, lords both mighty and evil, for the most \n",
      "part took up their abodes in the southlands far away; yet \n",
      "two there were, Herumor and Fuinur, who rose to power \n",
      "among the Haradrim, a great and cruel people that dwelt in \n",
      "the wide lands south of Mordor beyond the mouths of \n",
      "Anduin. \n",
      "\n",
      "When therefore Sauron saw his time he came with \n",
      "great force against the new realm of Gondor, and he took \n",
      "Minas Ithil, and he destroyed the White Tree of Isildur that \n",
      "grew there. But Isildur escaped, and taking with him a \n",
      "seedling of the Tree he went with his wife and his sons by \n",
      "ship down the River, and they sailed from the mouths of \n",
      "Anduin seeking Elendil. Meanwhile Anarion held Osgiliath \n",
      "against the Enemy, and for that time drove him back to the \n",
      "mountains; but Sauron gathered his strength again, and \n",
      "Anarion knew that unless help should come his kingdom \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "would not long stand. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now Elendil and Gil-galad took counsel together, for \n",
      "they perceived that Sauron would grow too strong and \n",
      "would overcome all his enemies one by one, if they did not \n",
      "unite against him. Therefore they made that League which \n",
      "is called the Last Alliance, and they marched east into \n",
      "Middle-earth gathering a great host of Elves and Men; and \n",
      "they halted for a while at Imladris. It is said that the host that \n",
      "was there assembled was fairer and more splendid in arms \n",
      "than any that has since been seen in Middle-earth, and \n",
      "none greater has been mustered since the host of the Valar \n",
      "went against Thangorodrim. \n",
      "\n",
      "From Imladris they crossed the Misty Mountains by \n",
      "many passes and marched down the River Anduin, and so \n",
      "came at last upon the host of Sauron on Dagorlad, the \n",
      "Battle Plain, which lies before the gate of the Black Land. \n",
      "All living things were divided in that day, and some of every \n",
      "kind, even of beasts and birds, were found in either host, \n",
      "save the Elves only. They alone were undivided and \n",
      "followed Gil-galad. Of the Dwarves few fought upon either \n",
      "side; but the kindred of Durin of Moria fought against \n",
      "Sauron. \n",
      "\n",
      "The host of Gil-galad and Elendil had the victory, for \n",
      "the might of the Elves was still great in those days, and the \n",
      "Numenoreans were strong and tall, and terrible in their \n",
      "wrath. Against Aeglos the spear of Gil-galad none could \n",
      "stand; and the sword of Elendil filled Ores and Men with \n",
      "fear, for it shone with the light of the sun and of the moon, \n",
      "and it was named Narsil. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then Gil-galad and Elendil passed into Mordor and \n",
      "encompassed the stronghold of Sauron; and they laid \n",
      "siege to it for seven years, and suffered grievous loss by \n",
      "fire and by the darts and bolts of the Enemy, and Sauron \n",
      "sent many sorties against them. There in the valley of \n",
      "Gorgoroth Anarion son of Elendil was slain, and many \n",
      "others. But at the last the siege was so strait that Sauron \n",
      "himself came forth; and he wrestled with Gil-galad and \n",
      "Elendil, and they both were slain, and the sword of Elendil \n",
      "broke under him as he fell. But Sauron also was thrown \n",
      "down, and with the hilt-shard of Narsil Isildur cut the Ruling \n",
      "Ring from the hand of Sauron and took it for his own. Then \n",
      "Sauron was for that time vanquished, and he forsook his \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "body, and his spirit fled far away and hid in waste places; \n",
      "and he took no visible shape again for many long years. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus began the Third Age of the World, after the \n",
      "Eldest Days and the Black Years; and there was still hope \n",
      "in that time and the memory of mirth, and for long the White \n",
      "Tree of the Eldar flowered in the courts of the Kings of Men, \n",
      "for the seedling which he had saved Isildur planted in the \n",
      "citadel of Anor in memory of his brother, ere he departed \n",
      "from Gondor. The servants of Sauron were routed and \n",
      "dispersed, yet they were not wholly destroyed; and though \n",
      "many Men turned now from evil and became subject to the \n",
      "heirs of Elendil, yet many more remembered Sauron in \n",
      "their hearts and hated the kingdoms of the West. The Dark \n",
      "Tower was levelled to the ground, yet its foundations \n",
      "remained, and it was not forgotten. The Numenoreans \n",
      "indeed set a guard upon the land of Mordor, but none \n",
      "dared dwell there because of the terror of the memory of \n",
      "Sauron, and because of the Mountain of Fire that stood \n",
      "nigh to Barad-dur; and the valley of Gorgoroth was filled \n",
      "with ash. Many of the Elves and many of the Numenoreans \n",
      "and of Men who were their allies had perished in the Battle \n",
      "and the Siege; and Elendil the Tall and Gil-galad the High \n",
      "King were no more. Never again was such a host \n",
      "assembled, nor was there any such league of Elves and \n",
      "Men; for after Elendilâ€™s day the two kindreds became \n",
      "estranged. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Ruling Ring passed out of the knowledge even of \n",
      "the Wise in that age; yet it was not unmade. For Isildur \n",
      "would not surrender it to Elrond and Cirdan who stood by. \n",
      "They counselled him to cast it into the fire of Orodruin nigh \n",
      "at hand, in which it had been forged, so that it should \n",
      "perish, and the power of Sauron be for ever diminished, \n",
      "and he should remain only as a shadow of malice in the \n",
      "wilderness. But Isildur refused this counsel, saying: This I \n",
      "will have as were-gild for my father's death, and my \n",
      "brothers. Was it not I that dealt the Enemy his death-blow?' \n",
      "And the Ring that he held seemed to him exceedingly fair to \n",
      "look on; and he would not suffer it to be destroyed. Taking it \n",
      "therefore he returned at first to Minas Anor, and there \n",
      "planted the White Tree in memory of his brother Anarion. \n",
      "But soon he departed, and after he had given counsel to \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Meneldil, his brother's son, and had committed to him the \n",
      "realm of the south, he bore away the Ring, to be an \n",
      "heirloom of his house, and marched north from Gondor by \n",
      "the way that Elendil had come; and he forsook the South \n",
      "Kingdom, for he purposed to take up his father's realm in \n",
      "Eriador, far from the shadow of the Black Land. \n",
      "\n",
      "But Isildur was overwhelmed by a host of Ores that lay \n",
      "in wait in the Misty Mountains; and they descended upon \n",

      "all his foes were overthrown. There well nigh all his people \n",
      "were slain, and among them were his three elder sons, \n",
      "Elendur, Aratan, and Ciryon; but his wife and his youngest \n",
      "son, Valandil, he had left in Imladris when he went to the \n",

      "he wore it he was invisible to all eyes; but the Ores hunted \n",
      "him by scent and slot, until he came to the River and \n",
      "plunged in. There the Ring betrayed him and avenged its \n",
      "maker, for it slipped from his finger as he swam, and it was \n",
      "lost in the water. Then the Ores saw him as he laboured in \n",
      "the stream, and they shot him with many arrows, and that \n",
      "was his end. Only three of his people came ever back over \n",
      "the mountains after long wandering; and of these one was \n",

      "Isildur's heir, in Imladris; but the blade was broken and its \n",
      "light was extinguished, and it was not forged anew. And \n",
      "Master Elrond foretold that this would not be done until the \n",
      "Ruling Ring should be found again and Sauron should \n",

      "or to maintain all the places that Elendil had built; in \n",
      "Dagorlad, and in Mordor, and upon the Gladden Fields \n",

      "Of the Three Rings that the Elves had preserved \n",

      "and few even of the Eldar knew where they were bestowed. \n",
      "Yet after the fall of Sauron their power was ever at work, \n",
      "and where they abode there mirth also dwelt and all things \n",
      "were unstained by the griefs of time. Therefore ere the \n",
      "Third Age was ended the Elves perceived that the Ring of \n",
      "Sapphire was with Elrond, in the fair valley of Rivendell, \n",
      "upon whose house the stars of heaven most brightly shone; \n",
      "whereas the Ring of Adamant was in the Land of Lorien \n",
      "where dwelt the Lady Galadriel. A queen she was of the \n",
      "woodland Elves, the wife of Celeborn of Doriath, yet she \n",

      "the Elves remained still undiminished while that Age \n",

      "between Celebrant and Anduin, where the trees bore \n",
      "flowers of gold and no Ore or evil thing dared ever come. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet many voices were heard among the Elves foreboding \n",
      "that, if Sauron should come again, then either he would find \n",
      "the Ruling Ring that was lost, or at the best his enemies \n",
      "would discover it and destroy it; but in either chance the \n",
      "powers of the Three must then fail and all things maintained \n",
      "by them must fade, and so the Elves should pass into the \n",

      "\n",
      "And so indeed it has since befallen: the One and the \n",

      "Those were the Fading Years, and in them the last \n",
      "flowering of the Elves east of the Sea came to its winter. In \n",
      "that time the Noldor walked still in the Hither Lands, \n",
      "mightiest and fairest of the children of the world, and their \n",
      "tongues were still heard by mortal ears. Many things of \n",
      "beauty and wonder remained on earth in that time, and \n",
      "many things also of evil and dread: Ores there were and \n",
      "trolls and dragons and fell beasts, and strange creatures \n",
      "old and wise in the woods whose names are forgotten; \n",
      "Dwarves still laboured in the hills and wrought with patient \n",
      "craft works of metal and stone that none now can rival. But \n",
      "the Dominion of Men was preparing and all things were \n",
      "changing, until at last the Dark Lord arose in Mirkwood \n",
      "again. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now of old the name of that forest was Greenwood the \n",
      "Great, and its wide halls and aisles were the haunt of many \n",
      "beasts and of birds of bright song; and there was the realm \n",
      "of King Thranduil under the oak and the beech. But after \n",
      "many years, when well nigh a third of that age of the world \n",
      "had passed, a darkness crept slowly through the wood from \n",
      "the southward, and fear walked there in shadowy glades; \n",
      "fell beasts came hunting, and cruel and evil creatures laid \n",
      "there their snares. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the name of the forest was changed and \n",
      "Mirkwood it was called, for the nightshade lay deep there, \n",
      "and few dared to pass through, save only in the north where \n",
      "Thranduilâ€™s people still held the evil at bay. Whence it came \n",
      "few could tell, and it was long ere even the Wise could \n",
      "discover it. It was the Shadow of Sauron and the sign of his \n",
      "return. For coming out of the wastes of the East he took up \n",
      "his abode in the south of the forest, and slowly he grew and \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "took shape there again; in a dark hill he made his dwelling \n",
      "and wrought there his sorcery, and all folk feared the \n",
      "Sorcerer of Dol Guldur, and yet they knew not at first how \n",
      "great was their peril. \n",
      "\n",
      "Even as the first shadows were felt in Mirkwood there \n",
      "appeared in the west of Middle-earth the Istari, whom Men \n",
      "called the Wizards. None knew at that time whence they \n",
      "were, save Cirdan of the Havens, and only to Elrond and to \n",
      "Galadriel did he reveal that they came over the Sea. But \n",
      "afterwards it was said among the Elves that they were \n",
      "messengers sent by the Lords of the West to contest the \n",
      "power of Sauron, if he should arise again, and to move \n",
      "Elves and Men and all living things of good will to valiant \n",
      "deeds. In the likeness of Men they appeared, old but \n",
      "vigorous, and they changed little with the years, and aged \n",
      "but slowly, though great cares lay on them; great wisdom \n",
      "they had, and many powers of mind and hand. Long they \n",
      "journeyed far and wide among Elves and Men, and held \n",
      "converse also with beasts and with birds; and the peoples \n",
      "of Middle-earth gave to them many names, for their true \n",
      "names they did not reveal. Chief among them were those \n",
      "whom the Elves called Mithrandir and Curunir, but Men in \n",
      "the North named Gandalf and Saruman. Of these Curunir \n",
      "was the eldest and came first, and after him came \n",
      "Mithrandir and Radagast, and others of the Istari who went \n",
      "into the east of Middle-earth, and do not come into these \n",
      "tales. Radagast was the friend of all beasts and birds; but \n",
      "Curunir went most among Men, and he was subtle in \n",
      "speech and skilled in all the devices of smith-craft. \n",
      "Mithrandir was closest in counsel with Elrond and the Elves. \n",
      "He wandered far in the North and West and made never in \n",
      "any land any lasting abode; but Curunir journeyed into the \n",
      "East, and when he returned he dwelt at Orthanc in the Ring \n",
      "of Isengard, which the Numenoreans made in the days of \n",
      "their power. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ever most vigilant was Mithrandir, and he it was that \n",
      "most doubted the darkness in Mirkwood, for though many \n",
      "deemed that it was wrought by the Ringwraiths, he feared \n",
      "that it was indeed the first shadow of Sauron returning; and \n",
      "he went to Dol Guldur, and the Sorcerer fled from him, and \n",
      "there was a watchful peace for a long while. But at length \n",
      "the Shadow returned and its power increased; and in that \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "time was first made the Council of the Wise that is called \n",
      "the White Council, and therein were Elrond and Galadriel \n",
      "and Cirdan, and other lords of the Eldar, and with them \n",
      "were Mithrandir and Curunir. And Curunir (that was \n",
      "Saruman the White) was chosen to be their chief, for he \n",
      "had most studied the devices of Sauron of old. Galadriel \n",
      "indeed had wished that Mithrandir should be the Lead of \n",
      "the Council, and Saruman begrudged them that, for his \n",
      "pride and desire of mastery was grown great; but \n",
      "Mithrandir refused the office, since he would have no ties \n",
      "and no allegiance, save to those who sent him, and he \n",
      "would abide in no place nor be subject to any summons. \n",
      "But Saruman now began to study the lore of the Rings of \n",
      "Power, their making and their history. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now the Shadow grew ever greater, and the hearts of \n",
      "Elrond and Mithrandir darkened. Therefore on a time \n",
      "Mithrandir at great peril went again to Dol Guldur and the \n",
      "pits of the Sorcerer, and he discovered the truth of his \n",
      "fears, and escaped. And returning to Elrond he said: \n",
      "\n",
      "True, alas, is our guess. This is not one of the Ulairi, \n",
      "as many have long supposed. It is Sauron himself who has \n",
      "taken shape again and now grows apace; and he is \n",
      "gathering again all the Rings to his hand; and he seeks \n",
      "ever for news of the One, and of the Heirs of Isildur, if they \n",
      "live still on earth.â€™ \n",
      "\n",
      "And Elrond answered: â€˜In the hour that Isildur took the \n",
      "Ring and would not surrender it, this doom was wrought, \n",
      "that Sauron should return.â€™ \n",
      "\n",
      "â€˜Yet the One was lost,' said Mithrandir, â€˜and while it still \n",
      "lies hid, we can master the Enemy, if we gather our strength \n",
      "and tarry not too long.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Then the White Council was summoned; and \n",
      "Mithrandir urged them to swift deeds, but Curunir spoke \n",
      "against him, and counselled them to wait yet and to watch. \n",
      "\n",
      "â€˜For I believe not,â€™ said he, â€˜that the One will ever be \n",
      "found again in Middle-earth. Into Anduin it fell, and long \n",
      "ago, I deem, it was rolled to the Sea. There it shall lie until \n",
      "the end, when all this world is broken and the deeps are \n",
      "removed.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore naught was done at that time, though \n",
      "Elrond's heart misgave him, and he said to Mithrandir: \n",
      "\n",
      "'Nonetheless I forbode that the One will yet be found, \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "and then war will arise again, and in that war this Age will \n",
      "be ended. Indeed in a second darkness it will end, unless \n",
      "some strange chance deliver us that my eyes cannot see.â€™ \n",
      "\n",
      "'Many are the strange chances of fee world,â€™ said \n",
      "Mithrandir, 'and help oft shall come from the hands of the \n",
      "weak when the Wise falter.' \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus the Wise were troubled, but none as yet \n",
      "perceived that Curunir had turned to dark thoughts and was \n",
      "already a traitor in heart: for he desired that he and no other \n",
      "should find the Great Ring, so that he might wield it himself \n",
      "and order all the world to his will. Too long he had studied \n",
      "the ways of. Sauron in hope to defeat him, and now he \n",
      "envied him as a rival rather than hated his works. And he \n",
      "deemed that the Ring, which was Sauron's, would seek for \n",
      "its master as he became manifest once more; but if he \n",
      "were driven out again, then it would lie hid. Therefore he \n",
      "was willing to play with peril and let Sauron be for a time, \n",
      "hoping by his craft to forestall both his friends and the \n",
      "Enemy, when the Ring should appear. \n",
      "\n",
      "He set a watch upon the Gladden Fields; but soon he \n",
      "discovered that the servants of Dol Guldur were searching \n",
      "all the ways of the River in that region. Then he perceived \n",
      "that Sauron also had learned of the manner of Isildur's end, \n",
      "and he grew afraid and withdrew to Isengard and fortified it; \n",
      "and ever he probed deeper into the lore of the Rings of \n",
      "Power and the art of their forging. But he spoke of none of \n",
      "this to the Council, hoping still that he might be the first to \n",
      "hear news of the Ring. He gathered a great host of spies, \n",
      "and many of these were birds; for Radagast lent him his \n",
      "aid, divining naught of his treachery, and deeming that this \n",
      "was but part of the watch upon the Enemy. \n",
      "\n",
      "But ever the shadow in Mirkwood grew deeper, and to \n",
      "Dol Guldur evil things repaired out of all the dark places of \n",
      "the world; and they were united again under one will, and \n",
      "their malice was directed against the Elves and the \n",
      "survivors of Numenor. Therefore at last the Council was \n",

      "while it abides on earth and is not unmade, still the power \n",
      "that it holds will live, and Sauron will grow and have hope. \n",
      "The might of the Elves and the Elf-friends is less now than \n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Now by fortune and his vigilance Mithrandir first \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "nor could it be unmade by the craft of the Elves. Therefore \n",
      "with the help of the Dunedain of the North Mithrandir set a \n",
      "watch upon the land of the Periannath and bided his time. \n",
      "But Sauron had many ears, and soon he heard rumour of \n",
      "the One Ring, which above all things he desired, and he \n",
      "sent forth the Nazgul to take it. Then war was kindled, and \n",

      "begun. \n",
      "\n",
      "But those who saw the things that were done in that \n",
      "time, deeds of valour and wonder, have elsewhere told the \n",
      "tale of the War of the Ring, and how it ended both in victory \n",
      "unlocked for and in sorrow long foreseen. Here let it be \n",
      "said that in those days the Heir of Isildur arose in the North, \n",
      "and he took the shards of the sword of Elendil, and in \n",
      "Imladris they were reforged; and he went then to war, a \n",
      "great captain of Men. He was Aragorn son of Arathorn, the \n",
      "nine and thirtieth heir in the right line from Isildur, and yet \n",
      "more like to Elendil than any before him. Battle there was in \n",
      "Rohan, and Curunir the traitor was thrown down and \n",
      "Isengard broken; and before the City of Gondor a great \n",
      "field was fought, and the Lord of Morgul, Captain of Sauron, \n",
      "there passed into darkness; and the Heir of Isildur led the \n",
      "host of the West to the Black Gates of Mordor. \n",
      "\n",
      "In that last battle were Mithrandir, and the sons of \n",
      "Elrond, and the King of Rohan, and lords of Gondor, and \n",
      "the Heir of Isildur with the Dunedain of the North. There at \n",
      "the last they looked upon death and defeat, and all their \n",
      "valour was in vain; for Sauron was too strong. Yet in that \n",
      "hour was put to the proof that which Mithrandir had spoken, \n",
      "and help came from the hands of the weak when the Wise \n",
      "faltered. For, as many songs have since sung, it was the \n",
      "Periannath, the Little People, dwellers in hillsides and \n",
      "meadows, that brought them deliverance. \n",
      "\n",
      "For Frodo the Halfling, it is said, at the bidding of \n",
      "Mithrandir took on himself the burden, and alone with his \n",
      "servant he passed through peril and darkness and came at \n",
      "last in Sauron's despite even to Mount Doom; and there \n",
      "into the Fire where it was wrought he cast the Great Ring of \n",
      "Power, and so at last it was unmade and its evil consumed. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Sauron failed, and he was utterly vanquished and \n",
      "passed away like a shadow of malice; and the towers of \n",
      "Barad-dur crumbled in ruin, and at the rumour of their fall \n",
      "many lands trembled. Thus peace came again, and a new \n",
      "Spring opened on earth; and the Heir of Isildur was \n",
      "crowned King of Gondor and Arnor, and the might of the \n",
      "Dunedain was lifted up and their glory renewed. In the \n",
      "courts of Minas Anor the White Tree flowered again, for a \n",
      "seedling was found by Mithrandir in the snows of Mindolluin \n",
      "that rose tall and white above the City of Gondor; and while \n",
      "it still grew there the Elder Days were not wholly forgotten in \n",
      "the hearts of the Kings. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now all these things were achieved for the most part \n",
      "by the counsel and vigilance of Mithrandir, and in the last \n",
      "few days he was revealed as a lord of great reverence, and \n",
      "clad in white he rode into battle; but not until the time came \n",
      "for him to depart was it known that he had long guarded the \n",
      "Red Ring of Fire. At the first that Ring had been entrusted \n",
      "to Cirdan, Lord of the Havens; but he had surrendered it to \n",

      "had passed to him, then it was made plain that the power of \n",
