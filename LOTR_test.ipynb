Then Rian departed \\nfrom Hithlum, and going to the Haudh-en-Ndengin she laid \\nherself down upon it and died. \\n\\nMorwen, daughter of Baragund, was the wife of Hurin, \\nLord of Dor-lomin; and their son was Turin, who was born in \\nthe year that Beren Erchamion came upon Luthien in the \\nForest of Neldoreth. A daughter they had also who was \\ncalled Lalaith, which is Laughter, and she was beloved by \\nTurin her brother; but when she was three years old there \\ncame a pestilence to Hithlum, borne on an evil wind out of \\nAngband, and she died. \\n\\n\\nNow after the Nimaeth Arnoediad Morwen abode still \\nin Dor-lomin, for Turin was but eight years old, and she was \\nagain with child. Those days were evil; for the Easterlings \\nthat came into Hithlum despised the remnant of the people \\nof Hador, and they oppressed them, and took their lands \\nand their goods, and enslaved their children. But so great \\nwas the beauty and majesty of the Lady of Dor-lomin that \\nthe Easterlings were afraid, and dared not to lay hands \\nupon her or her household; and they whispered among \\nthemselves, saying that she was perilous, and a witch \\nskilled in magic and in league with the Elves. Yet she was \\nnow poor and without aid, save that she was succoured \\nsecretly by a kinswoman of Hurin named Aerin, whom \\nBrodda, an Easterling, had taken as his wife; and Morwen \\nfeared greatly that Turin would be taken from her and \\nenslaved. Therefore it came into her heart to send him \\naway in secret, and to beg King Thingol to harbour him, for \\nBeren son of Barahir was her father's kinsman, and he had \\nbeen moreover a friend of Hurin, ere evil befell. Therefore in \\nthe autumn of the Year of Lamentation Morwen sent Turin \\nforth over the mountains with two aged servants, bidding \\nthem find entry, if they could, into the kingdom of Doriath. \\nThus was the fate of Turin woven, which is fulltold in that lay \\nthat is called Nam i HTn Hurin, the Tale of the Children of \\nHurin, and is the longest of all the lays that speak of those \\ndays. Here that tale is told in brief, for it is woven with the \\nfate of the Silmarils and of the Elves; and it is called the \\nTale of Grief, for it i\", 'polarity': 0, 'meta': {'language': 'en'}}, {'text': \"s sorrowful, and in it are revealed most \\nevil works of Morgoth Bauglir. \\n\\nIn the first beginning of the year Morwen gave birth to \\nher child, the daughter of Hurin; and she named her Nienor, \\nwhich is Mourning. But Turin and his companions passing \\nthrough great perils came at last to the borders of Doriath; \\nand there they were found by Beleg Strongbow, chief of the \\nmarchwardens of King Thingol, who led them to Menegroth. \\nThen Thingol received Turin, and took him even to his own \\nfostering, in honour of Hurin the Steadfast; for Thingol's \\nmood was changed towards the houses of the Elf-friends. \\nThereafter messengers went north to Hithlum, bidding \\nMorwen leave Dor-lomin and return with them to Doriath; \\nbut still she would not leave the house in which she had \\ndwelt with Hurin. And when the Elves departed she sent \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nwith them the Dragon-helm of Dor-lomin, greatest of the \\nheirlooms of the house of Hador. \\n\\nTurin grew fair and strong in Doriath, but he was \\nmarked with sorrow. For nine years he dwelt in Thingol's \\nhalls, and during that time his grief grew less; for \\nmessengers went at times to Hithlum, and returning they \\nbrought better tidings of Morwen and Nienor. \\n\\nBut there came a day when the messengers did not \\nreturn out of die north, and Thingol would send no more. \\nThen Turin was filled with fear for his mother and his sister, \\nand in grimness of heart he went before the King and \\nasked for mail and sword; and he put on the Dragon-helm \\nof Dor-lomin and went out to battle on the marches of \\nDoriath, and became the companion in arms of Beleg \\nCuthalion. \\n\\nAnd when three years had passed, Turin returned \\nagain to Menegroth; but he came from the wild, and was \\nunkempt, and his gear and garments were way-worn. Now \\none there was in Doriath, of the people of the Nandor, high \\nin the counsels of the King; Saeros was his name. He had \\nlong begrudged to Turin the honour he received as \\nThingol's fosterson; and seated opposite to him at the \\nboard he taunted him, saying: \\n\\n'If the Men of Hithlum are so wild and fell, of what sort \\nare the women of that land? Do they run like deer clad only \\nin their hair?' Then Turin in great anger took up a drinking- \\n\\n\\n\\nOn the next day Saeros waylaid Turin as he set out \\nfrom Menegroth to return to the marches; but Turin \\novercame him, and set him to run naked as a hunted beast \\nthrough the woods. Then Saeros fleeing in terror before him \\nfell into the chasm of a stream, and his body was broken on \\na great rock in\", 'polarity': 0, 'meta': {'language': 'en'}}, {'text': \" the water. But others coming saw what was \\ndone, and Mablung was among them; and he bade Turin \\nreturn with him to Menegroth and abide the judgement of \\nthe King, seeking his pardon. But Turin, deeming himself \\nnow an outlaw and fearing to be held captive, refused \\nMablung's bidding, and turned swiftly away; and passing \\nthrough the Girdle of Melian he came into the woods west \\nof Sirion. There he joined himself to a band of such \\nhouseless and desperate men as could be found in those \\n\\n\\nevil days lurking in the wild; and their hands were turned \\nagainst all who came in their path Elves and Men and Ores. \\n\\nBut when all that had befallen was told and searched \\nout before Thingol, the King pardoned Turin, holding him \\nwronged. In that time Beleg Strongbow returned from the \\nnorth marches and came to Menegroth, seeking him; and \\nThingol spoke to Beleg, saying: 'I grieve, Cuthalion; for I \\ntook Hurin's son as my son, and so he shall remain, unless \\nHurin himself should return out of the shadows to claim his \\nown. I would not have any say that Turin was driven forth \\nunjustly into the wild, and gladly would I welcome him back; \\nfor I loved him well.' \\n\\nAnd Beleg answered: 'I will seek Turin until I find him, \\nand I will bring him back to Menegroth, if I can; for I love him \\nalso.' \\n\\nThen Beleg departed from Menegroth, and far across \\nBeleriand he sought in vain for tidings of Turin through \\nmany perils. \\n\\nBut Turin abode long among the outlaws, and became \\ntheir captain; and he named himself Neithan, the Wronged. \\nVery warily they dwelt in the wooded lands south of Teiglin; \\nbut when a year had passed since Turin fled from Doriath, \\nBeleg came upon their lair by night. It chanced that at that \\ntime Turin was gone from the camp; and the outlaws seized \\nBeleg and bound him, and treated him cruelly, for they \\nfeared him as a spy of the King of Doriath. But Turin \\nreturning and seeing what was done, was stricken with \\nremorse for all their evil and lawless deeds; and he \\nreleased Beleg, and they renewed their friendship, and \\nTurin foreswore thenceforward war or plunder against all \\nsave the servants of Angband. \\n\\nThen Beleg told Turin of King Thingol's pardon; and he \\nsought to persuade him by all means that he might to return \\nwith him to Doriath, saying that there was great need of his \\nstrength and valour on the north marches of the realm. 'Of \\nlate the Ores have found a way down out of Taur-nu-Fuin,' \\nhe said; 'they have made a road through the Pass of \\nAnach\", 'polarity': 4, 'meta': {'language': 'en'}}, {'text': \".' \\n\\n'I do not remember it,' said Turin. \\n\\n'Never did we go so far from the borders,' said Beleg. \\n'But you have seen the peaks of the Crissaegrim far off, \\nand to the east the dark walls of the Gorgoroth. Anach lies \\n\\n\\n\\nbetween, above the high springs of Mindeb, a hard and \\ndangerous road; yet many come by it now, and Dimbar \\nwhich used to be in peace is falling under the Black Hand, \\nand the Men of Brethil are troubled. We are needed there.' \\n\\nBut in the pride of his heart Turin refused the pardon of \\nthe King, and the words of Beleg were of no avail to change \\nhis mood. And he for his part urged Beleg to remain with \\nhim in the lands west of Sirion; but that Beleg would not do, \\nand he said: 'Hard you are, Turin, and stubborn. Now the \\nturn is mine. If you wish indeed to have the Strongbow \\nbeside you, look for me in Dimbar; for thither I shall return.' \\n\\nOn the next day Beleg set out, and Turin went with him \\na bowshot from the camp; but he said nothing. 'Is it farewell, \\nthen, son of Hurin?' said Beleg. Then Turin looked out \\nwestward, and he saw far off the great height of Amon \\nRudh; and unwitting of what lay before him he answered: \\n'You have said, seek me in Dimbar. But I say, seek for me \\non Amon Rudh! Else, this is our last farewell.' Then they \\nparted, in friendship, yet in sadness. \\n\\nNow Beleg returned to the Thousand Caves, and \\ncoming before Thingol and Melian he told them of all that \\nhad befallen, save only of his evil handling by Turin's \\ncompanions. Then Thingol sighed, and he said: \\n\\n'What more would Turin have me do?' \\n\\n'Give me leave, lord,' said Beleg, 'and I will guard him \\nand guide him as I may; then no man shall say that elven- \\nwords are lightly spoken. Nor would I wish to see so great a \\ngood run to nothing in the wild.' \\n\\nThen Thingol gave Beleg leave to do as he would; and \\nhe said: 'Beleg Cuthalion! For many deeds you have \\nearned my thanks; but not the least is the finding of my \\nfosterson. At this parting ask for any gift, and I will not deny \\nit to you.' \\n\\n'I ask then for a sword of worth,' said Beleg; 'for the \\nOres come now too thick and close for a bow only, and \\nsuch blade as I have is no match for their armour.' \\n\\n'Choose from all that I have,' said Thingol, 'save only \\nAranruth, my own.' \\n\\nThen Beleg chose Anglachel; and that was a sword of \\ngreat worth, and it was so named because it was made of \\niron that fell from heaven as a blazing star; it would cleave \\nall earth-delved iron. One other sword only in Middle-ear\", 'polarity': 2, 'meta': {'language': 'en'}}, {'text': \"th \\n\\n\\n\\nwas like to it. That sword does not enter into this tale, \\nthough it was made of the same ore by the same smith; \\nand that smith was Eol the Dark Elf, who took Aredhel \\nTurgon's sister to wife. He gave Anglachel to Thingol as \\nfee, which he begrudged, for leave to dwell in Nan Elmoth; \\nbut its mate Anguirel he kept, until it was stolen from him by \\nMaeglin, his son. \\n\\nBut as Thingol turned the hilt of Anglachel towards \\nBeleg, Melian looked at the blade; and she said: There is \\nmalice in this sword. The dark heart of the smith still dwells \\nin it. It will not love the hand it serves; neither will it abide \\nwith you long.' \\n\\n'Nonetheless I will wield it while I may,' said Beleg. \\n\\n'Another gift I will give to you, Cuthalion,' said Melian, \\n'that shall be your help in the wild, and the help also of those \\nwhom you choose.' And she gave him store of lembas, the \\nwaybread of the Elves, wrapped in leaves of silver, and the \\nthreads that bound it were sealed at the knots with the seal \\nof the Queen, a wafer of white wax shaped as a single \\nflower of Telperion; for according to the customs of the \\nEldalie the keeping and giving of lembas belonged to the \\nQueen alone. In nothing did Melian show greater favour to \\nTurin than in this gift; for the Eldar had never before allowed \\nMen to use this waybread, and seldom did so again. \\n\\nThen Beleg departed with these gifts from Menegroth \\nand went back to the north marches, where he had his \\nlodges, and many friends. Then in Dimbar the Ores were \\ndriven back, and Anglachel rejoiced to be unsheathed; but \\nwhen the winter came, and war was stilled, suddenly his \\ncompanions missed Beleg, and he returned to them no \\nmore. \\n\\nNow when Beleg parted from the outlaws and returned \\ninto Doriath, Turin led them away westward out of Sirion's \\nvale; for they grew weary of their life without rest, ever \\nwatchful and in fear of pursuit, and they sought for a safer \\nlair. And it chanced at a time of evening that they came \\nupon three Dwarves, who fled before them; but one that \\nlagged behind was seized and thrown down, and a man of \\nthe company took his bow and let fly an arrow at the others \\nas they vanished in the dusk. Now the dwarf that they had \\ntaken was named MTm; and he pleaded for his life before \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTurin, and offered as ransom to lead them to his hidden \\nhalls which none might find without his aid. Then Turin pitied \\nMTm, and spared him; and he said: 'Where is your house?' \\n\\nThen Mim answered: 'High above the lands lie\", 'polarity': 0, 'meta': {'language': 'en'}}, {'text': \"s the \\nhouse of Mim, upon the great hill; Amon Rudh is that hill \\ncalled now, since the Elves changed all the names.' \\n\\nThen Turin was silent, and he looked long upon the \\ndwarf; and at last he said: 'You shall bring us to that place.' \\n\\nOn the next day they set out thither, following Mim to \\nAmon Rudh. Now that hill stood upon the edge of the \\nmoorlands that rose between the vales of Sirion and Narog, \\nand high above the stony heath it reared its crown; but its \\nsteep grey head was bare, save for the red seregon that \\nmantled the stone. And as the men of Turin's band drew \\nnear, the sun westering broke through the clouds, and fell \\nupon the crown; and the seregon was all in flower. Then \\nnnfi amnnn thpm Raid - 'Thprp is hlnnrl on thp hill-tnn ' \\n\\n\\n\\nBut MTm led them by secret paths up the steep slopes \\nof Amon Rudh; and at the mouth of his cave he bowed to \\nTurin, saying: 'Enter into Bar-en-Danwedh, the House of \\nRansom; for so it shall be called.' \\n\\nAnd now there came another dwarf bearing light to \\ngreet him, and they spoke together, and passed swiftly \\ndown into the darkness of the cave; but Turin followed after, \\nand came at length to a chamber far within, lit by dim lamps \\nhanging upon chains. There he found Mim kneeling at a \\nstone couch beside the wall, and he tore his beard, and \\nwailed, crying one name unceasingly; and on the couch \\nthere lay a third. But Turin entering stood beside Mim, and \\noffered him aid. Then Mim looked up at him, and said: 'You \\ncan give no aid. For this is KhTm, my son; and he is dead, \\npierced by an arrow. He died at sunset. Ibun my son has \\ntold me.' \\n\\nThen pity rose in Turin's heart, and he said to Mim: \\n'Alas! I would recall that shaft, if I could. Now Bar-en- \\nDanwedh this house shall be called in truth; and if ever I \\ncome to any wealth, I will pay you a ransom of gold for your \\nson, in token of sorrow, though it gladden your heart no \\nmore.' \\n\\nThen Mim rose, and looked long at Turin. 'I hear you,' \\nhe said. 'You speak like a dwarf-lord of old; and at that I \\n\\n\\nmarvel. Now my heart is cooled, though it is not glad; and in \\nthis house you may dwell, if you will; for I will pay my \\nransom.' \\n\\nSo began the abiding of Turin in the hidden house of \\nMTm upon Amon Rudh; and he walked on the greensward \\nbefore the mouth of the cave, and looked out east, and \\nwest, and north. Northward he looked, and descried the \\nForest of Brethil climbing green about Amon Obel in its \\nmidst, and thither his eyes were drawn ever and again, he\", 'polarity': 4, 'meta': {'language': 'en'}}, {'text': \" \\nknew not why; for his heart was set rather to the north-west, \\nwhere league upon league away on the skirts of the sky it \\nseemed to him that he could glimpse the Mountains of \\nShadow, the walls of his home. But at evening Turin looked \\nwest into the sunset, as the sun rode down red into the \\nhazes above the distant coasts, and the Vale of Narog lay \\ndeep in the shadows between. \\n\\nIn the time that followed Turin spoke much with MTm, \\nand sitting with him alone he listened to his lore and the tale \\nof his life. For MTm came of Dwarves that were banished in \\nancient days from the great Dwarf-cities of the east, and \\nlong before the return of Morgoth they wandered westward \\ninto Beleriand; but they became diminished in stature and \\nin smith-craft, and they took to lives of stealth, walking with \\nbowed shoulders and furtive steps. Before the Dwarves of \\nNogrod and Belegost came west over the mountains the \\nElves of Beleriand knew not what these others were, and \\nthey hunted them, and slew them; but afterwards they let \\nthem alone, and they were called Noegyth Nibin, the Petty- \\nDwarves, in the Sindarin tongue. They loved none but \\nthemselves, and if they feared and hated the Ores, they \\nhated the Eldar no less, and the Exiles most of all; for the \\nNoldor, they said, had stolen their lands and their homes. \\nLong ere King Finrod Felagund came over the Sea, the \\ncaves of Nargothrond were discovered by them, and by \\nthem its delving was begun; and beneath the crown of \\nAmon Rudh, the Bald Hill, the slow hands of the Petty- \\nDwarves had bored and deepened the caves through the \\nlong years that they dwelt there, untroubled by the Grey- \\nelves of the woods. But now at last they had dwindled and \\ndied out of Middle-earth, all save MTm and his two sons; \\nand MTm was old even in the reckoning of Dwarves, old and \\nforgotten. And in his halls the smithies were idle, and the \\n\\n\\n\\naxes rusted, and their name was remembered only in \\nancient tales of Doriath and Nargothrond. \\n\\nBut when the year drew on to midwinter, snow came \\ndown from the north heavier than they had known it in the \\nriver-vales, and Amon Rudh was covered deep; and they \\nsaid that the winters worsened in Beleriand as the power of \\nAngband grew. Then only the hardiest dared stir abroad; \\nand some fell sick, and all were pinched with hunger. But in \\nthe dim dusk of a winter's day there appeared suddenly \\namong them a man, as it seemed, of great bulk and girth, \\ncloaked and hooded in white; and he walked up to \", 'polarity': 0, 'meta': {'language': 'en'}}, {'text': \"the fire \\nwithout a word. And when men sprang up in fear, he \\nlaughed, and threw back his hood, and beneath his wide \\ncloak he bore a great pack; and in the light of the fire Turin \\nlooked again on the face of Beleg Cuthalion. \\n\\nThus Beleg returned once more to Turin, and their \\nmeeting was glad; and with him he brought out of Dimbar \\nthe Dragon-helm of Dor-lomin, thinking that it might lift \\nTurin's thought again above his life in the wilderness as the \\nleader of a petty company. But still Turin would not return to \\nDoriath; and Beleg yielding to his love against his wisdom \\nremained with him, and did not depart, and in that time he \\nlaboured much for the good of Turin's company. Those that \\nwere hurt or sick he tended, and gave to them the lembas \\nof Melian; and they were quickly healed, for though the \\nGrey-elves were less in skill and knowledge than the Exiles \\nfrom Valinor, in the ways of the life of Middle-earth they had \\na wisdom beyond the reach of Men. And because Beleg \\nwas strong and enduring, farsighted in mind as in eye, he \\ncame to be held in honour among the outlaws; but the \\nhatred of MTm for the Elf that had come into Bar-en- \\nDanwedh grew ever greater, and he sat with Ibun his son in \\nthe deepest shadows of his house, speaking to none. But \\nTurin paid now little heed to the Dwarf; and when winter \\npassed, and spring came, they had sterner work to do. \\n\\nWho knows now the counsels of Morgoth? Who can \\nmeasure the reach of his thought, who had been Melkor, \\nmighty among the Ainur of the Great Song, and sat now, a \\ndark lord upon a dark throne in the North, weighing in his \\nmalice all the tidings that came to him, and perceiving more \\nof the deeds and purposes of his enemies than even the \\nwisest of them feared, save only Melian the Queen? To her \\n\\n\\n\\noften the thought of Morgoth reached out, and there was \\nfoiled. \\n\\nAnd now again the might of Angband was moved; and \\nas the long fingers of a groping hand the forerunners of his \\narmies probed the ways into Beleriand. Through Anach \\nthey came, and Dimbar was taken, and all the north \\nmarches of Doriath.

For Turin put on again the Helm \\nof Hador; and far and wide in Beleriand the whisper went, \\nunder wood and over stream and through the passes of the \\nhills, saying that the Helm and Bow that had fallen in \\nDimbar had arisen again beyond hope. Then many who \\nwent leaderless, dispossessed but undaunted, took heart \\nagain, and came to seek the Two Captains. Dor-Cuarthol, \\nthe Land of Bow and Helm, was in that time named all the \\nregion between Teiglin and the west march of Doriath; and \\nTurin named himself anew, Gorthol, the Dread Helm, and \\nhis heart was high again. In Menegroth, and in the deep \\nhalls of Nargothrond, and even in the hidden realm of \\nGondolin, the fame of the deeds of the Two Captains was \\nheard; and in Angband also they were known. Then \\nMorgoth laughed, for now by the Dragon-helm was Hurin's \\nson revealed to him again; and ere long Amon Rudh was \\nringed with spies. \\n\\nIn the waning of the year MTm the Dwarf and Ibun his \\nson went out from Bar-en-Danwedh to gather roots in the \\nwild for their winter store; and they were taken captive by \\nOres. Then for a second time Mim promised to guide his \\nenemies by the secret paths to his home on Amon Rudh; \\nbut yet he sought to delay the fulfilment of his promise, and \\ndemanded that Gorthol should not be slain. Then the Ore- \\ncaptain laughed, and he said to Mim: 'Assuredly Turin son \\nof Hurin shall not be slain.' \\n\\nThus was Bar-en-Danwedh betrayed, for the Ores \\ncame upon it by night at unawares, guided by Mim. There \\n\\n\\n\\nmany of Turin's company were slain as they slept; but some \\nfleeing by an inner stair came out upon the hill-top, and \\nthere they fought until they fell, and their blood flowed out \\nupon the seregon that mantled the stone. But a net was \\ncast over Turin as he fought, and he was enmeshed in it, \\nand overcome, and led away. \\n\\nAnd at length when all was silent again MTm crept out \\nof the shadows of his house; and as the sun rose over the \\nmists of Sirion he stood beside the dead men on the hill- \\ntop. But he perceived that not all those that lay there were \\ndead; for by one his gaze was returned, and he looked in \\nthe eyes of Beleg the Elf. Then with hatred long-stored MTm \\nstepped up to Beleg, and drew forth the sword Anglachel \\nthat lay beneath the body of one that had fallen beside him; \\nbut Beleg stumbling up seized back the sword and thrust it \\nat the Dwarf, and MTm in terror fled wailing from the hill\", 'polarity': 0, 'meta': {'language': 'en'}}, {'text': \"-top. \\nAnd Beleg cried after him: The vengeance of the house of \\nHador will find you yet!' \\n\\nNow Beleg was sorely wounded, but he was mighty \\namong the Elves of Middle-earth, and he was moreover a \\nmaster of healing. Therefore he did not die, and slowly his \\nstrength returned; and he sought in vain among the dead for \\nTurin, to bury him. But he found him not; and then he knew \\nthat Hurin's son was yet alive, and taken to Angband. \\n\\nWith little hope Beleg departed from Amon Rudh and \\nset out northward, towards the Crossings of Teiglin, \\nfollowing in the track of the Ores; and he crossed over the \\nBrithiach and journeyed through Dimbar towards the Pass \\nof Anach. And now he was not far behind them, for he went \\nwithout sleeping, whereas they had tarried on their road, \\nhunting in the lands and fearing no pursuit as they came \\nnorthward; and not even in the dreadful woods of Taur-nu- \\nFuin did he swerve from the trail, for the skill of Beleg was \\ngreater than any that have been in Middle-earth. But as he \\npassed by night through that evil land he came upon one \\nlying asleep at the foot of a great dead tree; and Beleg \\nstaying his steps beside the sleeper saw that it was an Elf. \\nThen he spoke to him, and gave him lembas, and asked \\nhim what fate had brought him to that terrible place; and he \\nnamed himself Gwindor, son of Guilin. \\n\\nGrieving Beleg looked upon him; for Gwindor was now \\nbut a bent and fearful shadow of his former shape and \\n\\n\\n\\nmood, when in the Nirnaeth Arnoediad that lord of \\nNargothrond rode with rash courage to the very doors of \\nAngband, and there was taken. For few of the Noldor whom \\nMorgoth captured were put to death, because of their skill \\nin forging and in mining for metals and gems; and Gwindor \\nwas not slain, but put to labour in the mines of the North. By \\nsecret tunnels known only to themselves the mining Elves \\nmight sometimes escape; and thus it came to pass that \\nBeleg found him, spent and bewildered in the mazes of \\nTaur-nu-Fuin.' \\n\\nAnd Gwindor told him that as he lay and lurked among \\nthe trees he saw a great company of Ores passing \\nnorthwards, and wolves went with them; and among them \\nwas a Man, whose hands were chained, and they drove \\nhim onward with whips. 'Very tall he was', said Gwindor, 'as \\ntall as are the Men from the misty hills of Hithlum.' Then \\nBeleg told him of his own errand in Taur-nu-Fuin; and \\nGwindor sought to dissuade him from his quest, saying that \\nhe would but join Turin in the anguish that awaited him\", 'polarity': 0, 'meta': {'language': 'en'}}, {'text': \". But \\nBeleg would not abandon Turin, and despairing himself he \\naroused hope again in Gwindor's heart; and together they \\nwent on, following the Ores until they came out of the forest \\non the high slopes that ran down to the barren dunes of \\nAnfauglith. There within sight of the peaks of Thangorodrim \\nthe Ores made their encampment in a bare dell as the light \\nof day was failing, and setting wolf-sentinels all about they \\nfell to carousing. A great storm rode up out of the west, and \\nlightning glittered on the Shadowy Mountains far away, as \\nBeleg and Gwindor crept towards the dell. \\n\\nWhen all in the camp were sleeping Beleg took his \\nbow, and in the darkness shot the wolf-sentinels, one by \\none and silently. Then in great peril they entered in, and \\nthey found Turin fettered hand and foot and tied to a \\nwithered tree; and all about him knives that had been cast \\nat him were embedded in the trunk, and he was senseless \\nin a sleep of great weariness. But Beleg and Gwindor cut \\nthe bonds that held him, and lifting him they carried him out \\nof the dell; yet they could bear him no further than to a \\nthicket of thorn-trees a little way above. There they laid him \\ndown; and now the storm drew very near. Beleg drew his \\nsword Anglachel, and with it he cut the fetters that bound \\nTurin; but fate was that day more strong, for the blade \\n\\n\\n\\nslipped as he cut the shackles, and Turin's foot was \\npricked. Then he was aroused into a sudden wakefulness \\nof rage and fear, and seeing one bending over him with \\nnaked blade he leapt up with a great cry, believing that \\nOres were come again to torment him; and grappling with \\nhim in the darkness he seized Anglachel, and slew Beleg \\nCuthalion thinking him a foe. \\n\\nBut as he stood, finding himself free, and ready to sell \\nhis life dearly against imagined foes, there came a great \\nflash of lightning above them; and in its light he looked \\ndown on Beleg's face. Then Turin stood stone-still and \\nsilent, staring on that dreadful death, knowing what he had \\ndone; and so terrible was his face, lit by the lightning that \\nflickered all about them, that Gwindor cowered down upon \\nthe ground and dared not raise his eyes.' \\n\\nBut now in the dell beneath the Ores were aroused, \\nand all the camp was in a tumult; for they feared the thunder \\nthat came out of the west, believing that it was sent against \\nthem by the great Enemies beyond the Sea. Then a wind \\narose, and great rains fell, and torrents swept down from \\nthe heights of Taur-nu-Fui\", 'polarity': 0, 'meta': {'language': 'en'}}, {'text': \"n; and though Gwindor cried out \\nto Turin, warning him of their utmost peril, he made no \\nanswer, but sat unmoving and unweeping in the tempest \\nbeside the body of Beleg Cuthalion. \\n\\nWhen morning came the storm was passed away \\neastward over Lothlann, and the sun of autumn rose hot and \\nbright; but believing that Turin would have fled far away from \\nthat place and all trace of his flight be washed away, the \\nOres departed in haste without longer search, and far off \\nGwindor saw them marching away over the steaming \\nsands of Anfauglith. Thus it came to pass that they returned \\nto Morgoth empty-handed, and left behind them the son of \\nHurin, who sat crazed and unwitting on the slopes of Taur- \\nnu-Fuin, bearing a burden heavier than their bonds. \\n\\nThen Gwindor roused Turin to aid him in the burial of \\nBeleg, and he rose as one that walked in sleep; and \\ntogether they laid Beleg in a shallow grave, and placed \\nbeside him Belthronding his great bow, that was made of \\nblack yew-wood.

But \\nGwindor was ever beside him to guard him and guide him; \\nand thus they passed westward over Sirion and came at \\nlength to Eithel Ivrin, the springs whence Narog rose \\nbeneath the Mountains of Shadow. There Gwindor spoke to \\nTurin, saying: 'Awake, Turin son of Hurin Thalion! On Ivrin's \\nlake is endless laughter.

And Gwindor gave the sword Anglachel \\ninto his hands, and Turin knew that it was heavy and strong \\nand had great power; but its blade was black and dull and \\nits edges blunt. Then Gwindor said: 'This is a strange \\nblade, and unlike any that I have seen in Middle-earth. It \\nmourns for Beleg even as you do. But be comforted; for I \\nreturn to Nargothrond of the house of Finarfin, and you shall \\ncome with me, and be healed and renewed.' \\n\\n'Who are you?' said Turin. \\n\\n'A wandering Elf, a thrall escaped, whom Beleg met \\nand comforted,' said Gwindor. 'Yet once I was Gwindor son \\nof Guilin, a lord of Nargothrond, until I went to the Nirnaeth \\nAmoediad, and was enslaved in Angband.' \\n\\n'Then have you seen Hurin son of Galdor, the warrior of \\nDor-lomin?' said Turin. \\n\\n'I have not seen him,' said Gwindor. 'But rumour of him \\nruns through Angband that he still defies Morgoth; and \\n\\n\\nMorgoth has laid a curse upon turn and all his kin.' \\n\\nThat I do believe,' said Turin. \\n\\nAnd now they arose, and departing from Eithel Ivrin \\nthey journeyed southward along the banks of Narog, until \\nthey were taken by scouts of the Elves and brought as \\nprisoners to the hidden stronghold. Thus did Turin come to \\nNargothrond. \\n\\nAt first his own people did not know Gwindor, who \\nwent out young and strong, and returned now seeming as \\none of the aged among mortal Men, because of his \\ntorments and his labours; but Finduilas daughter of \\nOrodreth the King knew him and welcomed him, for she \\nhad loved him before the Nirnaeth, and so greatly did \\nGwindor love her beauty that he named her Faelivrin, which \\nis the gleam of the sun on the pools of Ivrin. For Gwindor's \\nsake Turin was admitted with him into Nargothrond, and he \\ndwelt there in honour. But when Gwindor would tell his \\nname, Turin checked him, saying: 'I am Agarwaen the son \\nof Umarth (which is the Bloodstained, son of Ill-fate), a \\nhunter in the woods'; and the Elves of Nargothrond \\nquestioned him no more. \\n\\nIn the time that followed Turin grew high in favour with \\nOrodreth, and well-nigh all hearts were turned to him in \\nNargothrond. For he was young, and only now reached his \\nfull manhood; and he was in truth the son of Morwen \\nEledhwen to look upon: dark-haired and pale-skinned, with \\ngrey eyes, and his face more beautiful than any other \\namong mortal Men, in the Elder Days. His speech and \\nbearing were that of the ancient kingdom of Doriath, and \", 'polarity': 4, 'meta': {'language': 'en'}}, {'text': \"\\neven among the Elves he might be taken for one from the \\ngreat houses of the Noldor; therefore many called him \\nAdanedhel, the Elf-Man.

So great was his prowess and skill \\nin warfare on the confines of the Guarded Plain that he \\nhimself became known as Mormegil, the Black Sword; and \\nthe Elves said: 'The Mormegil cannot be slain, save by \\nmischance, or an evil arrow from afar.' Therefore they gave \\nhim dwarf-mail, to guard him; and in a grim mood he found \\nalso in the armouries a dwarf-mask all gilded, and he put it \\n\\n\\n\\non before battle, and his enemies fled before his face. \\n\\nThen the heart of Finduilas was turned from Gwindor \\nand against her will her love was given to Turin; but Turin \\ndid not perceive what had befallen. And being torn in heart \\nFinduilas became sorrowful; and she grew wan and silent. \\nBut Gwindor sat in dark thought; and on a time he spoke to \\nFinduilas, saying: 'Daughter of the house of Finarfin, let no \\ngrief lie between us; for though Morgoth has laid my life in \\nruin, you still I love. Go whither love leads you; yet beware! It \\nis not fitting that the Elder Children of lluvatar should wed \\nwith the Younger; nor is it wise, for they are brief, and soon \\npass, to leave us in widowhood while the world lasts. \\nNeither will fate suffer it, unless it be once or twice only, for \\nsome high cause of doom that we do not perceive.

In \\nthose days the Elves of Nargothrond forsook their secrecy \\nand went openly to battle, and great store of weapons were \\nmade; and by the counsel of Turin the Noldor built a mighty \\nbridge over the Narog from the Doors of Felagund, for the \\n\\n\\n\\nswifter passage of their arms. Then the servants of \\nAngband were driven out of all the land between Narog and \\nSirion eastward, and westward to the Nenning and the \\ndesolate Falas; and though Gwindor spoke ever against \\nTurin in the council of the King, holding it an ill policy, he fell \\ninto dishonour and none heeded him, for his strength was \\nsmall and he was no longer forward in arms. Thus \\nNargothrond was revealed to the wrath and hatred of \\nMorgoth; but still at Turin's prayer his true name was not \\nspoken, and though the fame of his deeds came into \\nDoriath and to the ears of Thingol, rumour spoke only of the \\nBlack Sword of Nargothrond. \\n\\n\\nIn that time of respite and hope, when because of the \\ndeeds of the Mormegil the power of Morgoth was stemmed \\nwest of Sirion, Morwen fled at last from Dor-lomin with \\nNienor her daughter, and adventured the long journey to \\nThingol's halls.

And in the autumn of the year, biding his hour, \\nMorgoth loosed upon the people of Narog the great host \\nthat he had long prepared; and Glaurung the Uruloki \\npassed over Anfauglith, and came thence into the north \\nvales of Sirion and there did great evil. Under the shadows \\nof Ered Wethrin he defiled the Eithel Ivrin, and thence he \\npassed into the realm of Nargothrond, and burned the \\nTalath Dirnen, the Guarded Plain, between Narog and \\nTeiglin. \\n\\nThen the warriors of Nargothrond went forth, and tall \\nand terrible on that day looked Turin, and the heart of the \\nhost was upheld, as he rode on the right hand of Orodreth. \\nBut greater far was the host of Morgoth than any scouts had \\ntold, and none but Turin defended by his dwarf-mask could \\nwithstand the approach of Glaurung; and the Elves were \\ndriven back and pressed by the Ores into the field of \\nTumhalad, between Ginglith and Narog, and there they \\nwere penned. On that day all the pride and host of \\nNargothrond withered away; and Orodreth was slain in the \\nforefront of the battle, and Gwindor son of Guilin was \\nwounded to the death. But Turin came to his aid, and all \\nfled before him; and he bore Gwindor out of the rout, and \\nescaping into a wood there laid him on the grass. \\n\\nThen Gwindor said to Turin: \\'Let bearing pay for \\nbearing!

But the host of the Ores and \\nGlaurung the Dragon were there before him, and they came \\nsuddenly, ere those that were left on guard were aware of \\nwhat had befallen on the field of Tumhalad. In that day the \\nbridge over Narog proved an evil; for it was great and \\nmightily made and could not swiftly be destroyed, and the \\nenemy came readily over the deep river, and Glaurung \\ncame in full fire against the Doors of Felagund, and \\noverthrew them, and passed within. \\n\\n\\n\\nAnd even as Turin came up the dreadful sack of \\nNargothrond was well nigh achieved. The Ores had slain or \\ndriven off all that remained in arms, and were even then \\nransacking the great halls and chambers, plundering and \\ndestroying; but those of the women and maidens that were \\nnot burned or slain they had herded on the terraces before \\nthe doors, as slaves to be taken into Morgoth's thraldom. \\nUpon this ruin and woe Turin came, and none could \\nwithstand him; or would not, though he struck down all \\nbefore him, and passed over the bridge, and hewed his \\n\\n\\nway towards the captives. \\n\\nAnd now he stood alone, for the few that followed him \\nhad fled. But in that moment Glaurung issued from the \\ngaping doors, and lay behind, between Turin and the \\nbridge. Then suddenly he spoke, by the evil spirit that was \\nin him, saying: 'Hail, son of Hurin. Well met!' \\n\\nThen Turin sprang about, and strode against him, and \\nthe edges of Gurthang shone as with flame; but Glaurung \\nwithheld his blast, and opened wide his serpent-eyes and \\ngazed upon Turin. Without fear Turin looked into them as he \\nraised up the sword; and straightway he fell under the \\nbinding spell of the lidless eyes of the dragon, and was \\nhalted moveless. Then for a long time he stood as one \\ngraven of stone; and they two were alone, silent before the \\ndoors of Nargothrond. But Glaurung spoke again, taunting \\nTurin, and he said: 'Evil have been all thy ways, son of \\nHurin. Thankless fosterling, outlaw, slayer of thy friend, thief \\nof love, usurper of Nargothrond, captain foolhardy, and \\ndeserter of thy kin. As thralls thy mother and thy sister live in \\nDor-lomin, in misery and want.

Glad may thy father be to learn that he \\nhath such a son; as learn he shall.' And Turin being under \\nthe spell of Glaurung hearkened to his words, and he saw \\nhimself as in a mirror misshapen by malice, and loathed \\nthat which he saw. \\n\\nAnd while he was yet held by the eyes of the dragon in \\ntorment of mind, and could not stir, the Ores drove away the \\nherded captives, and they passed nigh to Turin and \\ncrossed over the bridge. Among them was Finduilas, and \\nshe cried out to Turin as she went; but not until her cries \\nand the wailing of the captives was lost upon the northward \\nroad did Claiming release Turin, and he might not stop his \\nears against that voice that haunted him after. \\n\\nThen suddenly Glaurung withdrew his glance, and \\nwaited; and Turin stirred slowly, as one waking from a \\nhideous dream. Then coming to himself he sprang upon the \\ndragon with a cry. But Glaurung laughed, saying: 'If thou wilt \\nbe slain, I will slay thee gladly. But small help will that be to \\nMorwen and Nienor. No heed didst thou give to the cries of \\nthe Elf-woman. Wilt thou deny also the bond of thy blood?' \\n\\n\\n\\nBut Turin drawing back his sword stabbed at the \\ndragon's eyes; and Glaurung coiling back swiftly towered \\nabove him, and said: 'Nay! At least thou art valiant; beyond \\nall whom I have met And they lie who say that we of our part \\ndo not honour the valour of foes. See now! I offer thee \\nfreedom. Go to thy kin, if thou canst. Get thee gone! And if \\nElf or Man be left to make tale of these days, then surely in \\nscorn they will name thee, if thou spumest this gift.' \\n\\nThen Turin, being yet bemused by the eyes of the \\ndragon, as were he treating with a foe that could know pity, \\nbelieved the words of Glaurung and fuming away he sped \\nover the bridge. But as he went Glaurung spoke behind \\nhim, saying in a fell voice: 'Haste thee now, son of Hurin, to \\nDor-lomin! Or perhaps the Ores shall come before thee, \\nonce again. And if thou tarry for Finduilas, then never shalt \\nthou see Morwen again, and never at all shalt thou see \\nNienor thy sister; and they will curse thee.' \\n\\nBut Turin passed away on the northward road, and \\nGlaurung laughed once more, for he had accomplished the \\nerrand of his Master. Then he turned to his own pleasure, \\nand sent forth his blast, and burned all about him. But all the \\nOres that were busy in the sack he routed forth, and drove \\nthem away, and denied them their plunder even to the last \\nthing of worth. The bridge then \", 'polarity': 0, 'meta': {'language': 'en'}}, {'text': \"he broke down and cast into \\nthe foam of Narog; and being thus secure he gathered all \\nthe hoard and riches of Felagund and heaped them, and \\nlay upon them in the innermost hall, and rested a while. \\n\\nAnd Turin hastened along the ways to the north, \\nthrough the lands now desolate between Narog and Teiglin, \\nand the Fell Winter came down to meet him; for in that year \\nsnow fell ere autumn was passed, and spring came late \\nand cold. Ever it seemed to him as he went that he heard \\nthe cries of Finduilas, calling his name by wood and hill, \\nand great was his anguish; but his heart being hot with the \\nlies of Glaurung, and seeing ever in his mind the Ores \\nburning the house of Hurin or putting Morwen and Nienor to \\ntorment, he held on his way, and turned never aside. \\n\\nAt last worn by haste and the long road (for forty \\nleagues and more had he journeyed without rest) he came \\nwith the first ice of winter to the pools of Ivrin, where before \\nhe had been healed. But they were now but a frozen mire, \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nand he could drink there no more.' \\n\\nThus he came hardly by the passes of Dor-lomin, \\nthrough bitter snows from the north, and found again the \\nland of his childhood. Bare and bleak it was; and Morwen \\nwas gone. Her house stood empty, broken and cold; and \\nno living thing dwelt nigh. Therefore Turin departed, and \\ncame to the house of Brodda the Easterling, he that had to \\nwife Aerin, Hurin's kinswoman; and there he learned of an \\nold servant that Morwen was long gone, for she had fled \\nwith Nienor out of Dor-Lomin, none but Aerin knew where. \\n\\n\\nThen Turin strode to Brodda's table, and seizing him \\nhe drew his sword, and demanded that he be told whither \\nMorwen had gone; and Aerin declared to him that she went \\nto Doriath to seek her son. 'For the lands were freed then \\nfrom evil,' she said, 'by the Black Sword of the south, who \\nnow has fallen, they say.' Then Turin's eyes were opened, \\nand the last threads of Glaurung's spell were loosed; and \\nfor anguish, and wrath at the lies that had deluded him, and \\nhatred of the oppressors of Morwen, a black rage seized \\nhim, and he slew Brodda in his hall, and other Easterlings \\nthat were his guests. Thereafter he fled out into the winter, a \\n\\n\\n\\nhunted man; but he was aided by some that remained of \\nHador's people and knew the ways of the wild, and with \\nthem he escaped through the falling snow and came to an \\noutlaws' refuge in the southern mountains of Dor-lomin. \\nThence Turin passed again from the land of his childhood\", 'polarity': 0, 'meta': {'language': 'en'}}, {'text': \", \\nand returned to Sirion's vale. His heart was bitter, for to \\nDor-lomin he had brought only greater woe upon the \\nremnant of his people, and they were glad of his going; and \\nthis comfort alone he had: that by the prowess of the Black \\nSword the ways to Doriath had been laid open to Morwen. \\nAnd he said in his thought: Then those deeds wrought not \\nevil to all. And where else might I have better bestowed my \\nkin, even had I come sooner? For if the Girdle of Melian be \\nbroken, then last hope is ended. Nay, it is better indeed as \\nthings be; for a shadow I cast wheresoever I come. Let \\nMelian keep them! And I will leave them in peace \\nunshadowed for a while.' \\n\\nNow Turin coming down from Ered Wethrin sought for \\nFinduilas in vain, roaming the woods beneath the \\nmountains, wild and wary as a beast; and he waylaid all the \\nroads that went north to the Pass of Sirion. But he was too \\nlate; for all the trails had grown old, or were washed away \\nby the winter. Yet thus it was that passing southwards down \\nTeiglin Turin came upon some of the Men of Brethil that \\nwere surrounded by Ores; and he delivered them, for the \\nOres fled from Gurthang. He named himself Wildman of the \\nWoods, and they besought him to come and dwell with \\nthem; but he said that he had an errand yet unachieved, to \\nseek Finduilas, Orodreth's daughter of Nargothrond. Then \\nDorlas, the leader of those woodmen, told the grievous \\ntidings of her death. For the Men of Brethil had waylaid at \\nthe Crossings of Teiglin the Ore-host that led the captives \\nof Nargothrond, hoping to rescue them; but the Ores had at \\nonce cruelly slain their prisoners, and Finduilas they pinned \\nto a tree with a spear. So she died, saying at the last: 'Tell \\nthe Mormegil that Finduilas is here.' Therefore they had laid \\nher in a mound near that place, and named it Haudh-en- \\nElleth, the Mound of the Elf-maid. \\n\\nTurin bade them lead him thither, and there he fell \\ndown into a darkness of grief that was near death. Then \\nDorlas by his black sword, the fame whereof had come \\neven inter the deeps of Brethil, and by his quest of the \\n\\n\\n\\nKing's daughter, knew that this Wildman was indeed the \\nMormegil of Nargothrond, whom rumour said was the son \\nof Hurin of Dor-lomin. Therefore the woodmen lifted him up, \\nand bore him away to their homes.

And with the beginning of spring Turin cast off his \\ndarkness, and grew hale again; and he arose, and he \\nthought that he would remain in Brethil hidden, and put his \\nshadow behind him, forsaking the past. He took therefore a \\nnew name, Turambar, which in the High-elven speech \\nsignified Master of Doom; and he besought the woodmen \\nto forget that he was a stranger among them or ever bore \\nany other name. Nonetheless he would not wholly leave \\ndeeds of war; for he could not endure that the Ores should \\ncome to the Crossings of Teiglin or draw nigh to Haudh-en- \\nElleth, and he made that a place of dread for them, so that \\nthey shunned it. But he laid his black sword by, and wielded \\nrather the bow and the spear. \\n\\nNow new tidings came to Doriath concerning \\nNargothrond, for some that had escaped from the defeat \\nand the sack, and had survived the Fell Winter in the wild, \\ncame at last to Thingol seeking refuge; and the march- \\nwardens brought them to the King.

But all declared that it was known to \\nmany in Nargothrond ere the end that the Mormegil was \\nnone other than Turin son of Hurin of Dor-lomin. \\n\\nThen Morwen was distraught, and refusing the counsel \\nof Melian she rode forth alone into the wild to seek her son, \\n\\n\\n\\nor some true tidings of him. Thingol therefore sent Mablung \\nafter her, with many hardy march-wards, to find her and \\nguard her, and to learn what news they might; but Nienor \\nwas bidden to remain behind.

And after three days' journeying they came to \\nAmon Ethir, the Hill of Spies, that long ago Felagund had \\ncaused to be raised with great labour, a league before the \\ndoors of Nargothrond. There Mablung set a guard of riders \\nabout Morwen and her daughter, and forbade them to go \\nfurther. But he, seeing from the hill no sign of any enemy, \\nwent down with his scouts to the Narog, as stealthily as they \\ncould go. \\n\\nBut Glaurung was aware of all that they did, and he \\ncame forth in heat of wrath, and lay into the river; and a vast \\nvapour and foul reek went up, in which Mablung and his \\ncompany were blinded and lost Then Glaurung passed east \\nover Narog. \\n\\nSeeing the onset of the dragon the guards upon Amon \\nEthir sought to lead Morwen and Nienor away, and fly with \\nthem with all speed back eastwards; but the wind bore the \\nblank mists upon them, and their horses were maddened \\nby the dragon-stench, and were ungovernable, and ran this \\nway and that, so that some were dashed against trees and \\nwere slain, and others were borne far away. Thus the ladies \\nwere lost, and of Morwen indeed no sure tidings came ever \\nto Doriath after. But Nienor, being thrown by her steed, yet \\nunhurt, made her way back to Amon Ethir, there to await \\nMablung, and came thus above the reek into the sunlight; \\nand looking westward she stared straight into the eyes of \\nGlaurung, whose head lay upon the hill-top. \\n\\nHer will strove with him for a while, but he put forth his \\npower, and having learned who she was he constrained her \\n\\n\\n\\nto gaze into his eyes, and he laid a spell of utter darkness \\nand forgetfulness upon her, so that she could remember \\nnothing that had ever befallen her, nor her own name, nor \\nthe name of any other thing; and for many days she could \\nneither hear, nor see, nor stir by her own will.

Then \\nBrandir who had heard all, standing stricken upon the edge \\nof ruin, hastened towards her; but she ran from him \\ndistraught with horror and anguish, and coming to the brink \\nof Cabed-en-Aras she cast herself over, and was lost in the \\nwild water. \\n\\nThen Brandir came and looked down, and turned away \\nin horror; and though he no longer desired life, he could not \\nseek death in that roaring water. And thereafter no man \\nlooked again upon Cabed-en-Aras, nor would any beast or \\nbird come there, nor any tree grow; and it was named \\nCabed Naeramarth, the Leap of Dreadful Doom. \\n\\nBut Brandir made his way back to Nen Girith, to bring \\ntidings to the people; and he met Dorlas in the woods, and \\nslew him: the first blood that ever he had spilled, and the \\nlast. And he came to Nen Girith, and men cried to him: \\n'Have you seen her? For Niniel is gone.' \\n\\nAnd he answered: 'Niniel is go\", 'polarity': 0, 'meta': {'language': 'en'}}, {'text': \"ne for ever. The Dragon \\nis dead, and Turambar is dead; and those tidings are \\ngood.' The people murmured at these words, saying that he \\nwas crazed; but Brandir said: 'Hear me to the end! Niniel \\nthe beloved is also dead. She cast herself into Teiglin, \\ndesiring life no more; for she learned that she was none \\nother than Nienor daughter of Hurin of Dor-lomin, ere her \\nforgetfulness came upon her, and that Turambar was her \\nbrother, Turin son of Hurin. ' \\n\\nBut even as he ceased, and the people wept, Turin \\nhimself came before them. For when the dragon died, his \\nswoon left him, and he fell into a deep sleep of weariness. \\nBut the cold of the night troubled him, and the hilts of \\n\\n\\n\\nGurthang drove into his side, and he awoke. Then he saw \\nthat one had tended his hand, and he wondered much that \\nhe was left nonetheless to lie upon the cold ground; and he \\ncalled, and hearing no answer he went in search of aid, for \\nhe was weary and sick. \\n\\nBut when the people saw him they drew back in fear, \\nthinking that it was his unquiet spirit; and he said: 'Nay, be \\nglad; for the Dragon is dead, and I live. But wherefore have \\nyou scorned my counsel, and come into peril? And where is \\nNiniel? For her I would see. And surely you did not bring her \\nfrom her home?' \\n\\nThen Brandir told him that it was so, and Niniel was \\ndead. But the wife of Dorlas cried out: 'Nay, lord, he is \\ncrazed. For he came here saying that you were dead, and \\nhe called it good tidings. But you live.' \\n\\nThen Turambar was wrathful, and believed that all \\nBrandir said or did was done in malice towards himself and \\nNiniel, begrudging their love; and he spoke evilly to Brandir, \\ncalling him Club-foot. Then Brandir reported all that he had \\nheard, and named Niniel Nienor daughter of Hurin, and he \\ncried out upon Turambar with the last words of Glaurung, \\nthat he was a curse unto his kin and to all that harboured \\nhim. \\n\\nThen Turambar fell into a fury, for in those words he \\nheard the feet of his doom overtaking him; and he charged \\nBrandir with leading Niniel to her death, and publishing with \\ndelight the lies of Glaurung, if indeed be devised them not \\nhimself. Then he cursed Brandir, and slew him; and he fled \\nfrom the people into the woods. But after a while his \\nmadness left him, and he came to Haudh-en-Elleth, and \\nthere sat, and pondered all his deeds. And he cried upon \\nFinduilas to bring him counsel; for he knew not whether he \\nwould do now more ill to go to Doriath to seek his kin, or to \\nforsak\", 'polarity': 0, 'meta': {'language': 'en'}}, {'text': \"e them for ever and seek death in battle. \\n\\nAnd even as he sat there Mablung with a company of \\nGrey-elves came over the Crossings of Teiglin, and he \\nknew Turin, and hailed him, and was glad indeed to find \\nhim yet living; for he had learned of the coming forth of \\nGlaurung and that his path led to Brethil, and also he had \\nheard report that the Black Sword of Nargothrond now \\ndwelt there. Therefore he came to give warning to Turin, \\nand help if need be; but Turin said: 'You come too late. The \\n\\n\\n\\nDragon is dead.' \\n\\nThen they marvelled, and gave him great praise; but he \\ncared nothing for it, and said: This only I ask: give me news \\nof my kin, for in Dor-lomin I learned that they had gone to \\nthe Hidden Kingdom.' \\n\\nThen Mablung was dismayed, but needs must tell to \\nTurin how Morwen was lost, and Nienor cast into a spell of \\ndumb forgetfulness, and how she escaped them upon the \\nborders of Doriath and fled northwards. Then at last Turin \\nknew that doom had overtaken him, and that he had slain \\nBrandir unjustly; so that the words of Glaurung were fulfilled \\nin him. And he laughed as one fey, crying: This is a bitter \\njest indeed!' But he bade Mablung go, and return to \\nDoriath, with curses upon it. 'And a curse too upon your \\nerrand!' he cried. 'This only was wanting. Now comes the \\nnight.' \\n\\nThen he fled from them like the wind, and they were \\namazed, wondering what madness had seized him; and \\nthey followed after him. But Turin far out-ran them; and he \\ncame to Cabed-en-Aras, and heard the roaring of the \\nwater, and saw that all the leaves fell sere from the trees, as \\nthough winter had come. There he drew forth his sword, that \\nnow alone remained to him of all his possessions, and he \\nsaid: 'Hail Gurthang! No lord or loyalty dost thou know, save \\nthe hand that wieldeth thee. From no blood wilt thou shrink. \\nWilt thou therefore take Turin Turambar, wilt thou slay me \\nswiftly?' \\n\\nAnd from the blade rang a cold voice in answer: 'Yea, I \\nwill drink thy blood gladly, that so I may forget the blood of \\nBeleg my master, and the blood of Brandir slain unjustly. I \\nwill slay thee swiftly.' \\n\\nThen Turin set the hilts upon the ground, and cast \\nhimself upon the point of Gurthang, and the black blade \\ntook his life. But Mablung and the Elves came and looked \\non the shape of Glaurung lying dead, and upon the body of \\nTurin, and they grieved; and when Men of Brethil came \\nthither, and they learned the reasons of Turin's madness \\nand death, they were aghast; and Mablun\", 'polarity': 0, 'meta': {'language': 'en'}}, {'text': \"g said bitterly: 'I \\nalso have been meshed in the doom of the Children of \\nHurin, and thus with my tidings have slain one that I loved.' \\n\\nThen they lifted up Turin, and found that Gurthang had \\nbroken asunder. But Elves and Men gathered there great \\n\\n\\nstore of wood, and they made a mighty burning, and the \\nDragon was consumed to ashes. Turin they laid in a high \\nmound where he had fallen, and the shards of Gurthang \\nwere laid beside him. And when all was done, the Elves \\nsang a lament for the Children of Hurin, and a great grey \\nstone was set upon the mound, and thereon was carven in \\nrunes of Doriath: \\n\\nTURIN TURAMBAR DAGNIR GLAURUNGA \\n\\nand beneath they wrote also: \\n\\nNIENOR NINIEL \\n\\nBut she was not there, nor was it ever known whither \\nthe cold waters of Teiglin had taken her. \\n\\n\\n\\n\", 'polarity': 0, 'meta': {'language': 'en'}}]\n",
