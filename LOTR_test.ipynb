      "Hobbits are an unobtrusive but very ancient people, more numerous \n",
      "formerly than they are today; for they love peace and quiet and good tilled \n",
      "earth: a well-ordered and well-farmed countryside was their favourite haunt. \n",
      "They do not and did not understand or like machines more complicated than a \n",
      "forge -bellows, a water-mill, or a hand-loom, though they were skilful with \n",
      "tools. Even in ancient days they were, as a rule, shy of 'the Big Folk', as \n",
      "they call us, and now they avoid us with dismay and are becoming hard to \n",
      "find. They are quick of hearing and sharp-eyed, and though they are inclined \n",
      "to be fat and do not hurry unnecessarily, they are nonetheless nimble and \n",
      "deft in their movements. They possessed from the first the art of \n",
      "disappearing swiftly and silently, when large folk whom they do not wish to \n",
      "meet come blundering by; and this an they have developed until to Men it may \n",
      "seem magical. But Hobbits have never, in fact, studied magic of any kind, \n",
      "and their elusiveness is due solely to a professional skill that heredity \n",
      "and practice, and a close friendship with the earth, have rendered \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "inimitable by bigger and clumsier races. \n",
      "\n",
      "For they are a little people, smaller than Dwarves: less tout and \n",
      "stocky, that is, even when they are not actually much shorter. Their height \n",
      "is variable, ranging between two and four feet of our measure. They seldom \n",
      "now reach three feet; but they hive dwindled, they say, and in ancient days \n",
      "they were taller. According to the Red Book, Bandobras Took (Bullroarer), \n",
      "son of Isengrim the Second, was four foot five and able to ride a horse. He \n",
      "was surpassed in all Hobbit records only by two famous characters of old; \n",
      "but that curious matter is dealt with in this book. \n",
      "\n",
      "As for the Hobbits of the Shire, with whom these tales are concerned, \n",
      "in the days of their peace and prosperity they were a merry folk. They \n",
      "dressed in bright colours, being notably fond of yellow and green; but they \n",
      "seldom wore shoes, since their feet had tough leathery soles and were clad \n",
      "in a thick curling hair, much like the hair of their heads, which was \n",
      "commonly brown. Thus, the only craft little practised among them was \n",
      "shoe-making; but they had long and skilful fingers and could make many other \n",
      "useful and comely things. Their faces were as a rule good-natured rather \n",
      "than beautiful, broad, bright-eyed, red-cheeked, with mouths apt to \n",
      "laughter, and to eating and drinking. And laugh they did, and eat, and \n",
      "drink, often and heartily, being fond of simple jests at all times, and of \n",
      "six meals a day (when they could get them). They were hospitable and \n",
      "delighted in parties, and in presents, which they gave away freely and \n",
      "eagerly accepted. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is plain indeed that in spite of later estrangement Hobbits are \n",
      "relatives of ours: far nearer to us than Elves, or even than Dwarves. Of old \n",
      "they spoke the languages of Men, after their own fashion, and liked and \n",
      "disliked much the same things as Men did. But what exactly our relationship \n",
      "is can no longer be discovered. The beginning of Hobbits lies far back in \n",
      "the Elder Days that are now lost and forgotten. Only the Elves still \n",
      "preserve any records of that vanished time, and their traditions are \n",
      "concerned almost entirely with their own history, in which Men appear seldom \n",
      "and Hobbits are not mentioned at all. Yet it is clear that Hobbits had, in \n",
      "fact, lived quietly in Middle-earth for many long years before other folk \n",
      "became even aware of them. And the world being after all full of strange \n",
      "creatures beyond count, these little people seemed of very little \n",
      "importance. But in the days of Bilbo, and of Frodo his heir, they suddenly \n",

      "Those days, the Third Age of Middle -earth, are now long past, and the \n",
      "shape of all lands has been changed; but the regions in which Hobbits then \n",
      "lived were doubtless the same as those in which they still linger: the \n",
      "North-West of the Old World, east of the Sea. Of their original home the \n",
      "Hobbits in Bilbo's time preserved no knowledge. A love of learning (other \n",
      "than genealogical lore) was far from general among them, but there remained \n",
      "still a few in the older families who studied their own books, and even \n",
      "gathered reports of old times and distant lands from Elves, Dwarves, and \n",
      "Men. Their own records began only after the settlement of the Shire, and \n",
      "their most ancient legends hardly looked further back than their Wandering \n",
      "Days. It is clear, nonetheless, from these legends, and from the evidence of \n",
      "their peculiar words and customs, that like many other folk Hobbits had in \n",
      "the distant past moved westward. Their earliest tales seem to glimpse a time \n",
      "when they dwelt in the upper vales of Anduin, between the eaves of \n",
      "Greenwood \n",
      "\n",
      "the Great and the Misty Mountains. Why they later undertook the hard and \n",
      "perilous crossing of the mountains into Eriador is no longer certain. Their \n",
      "own accounts speak of the multiplying of Men in the land, and of a shadow \n",
      "that fell on the forest, so that it became darkened and its new name was \n",
      "Mirkwood. \n",
      "\n",
      "Before the crossing of the mountains the Hobbits had already become \n",
      "divided into three somewhat different breeds: Harfoots, Stoors, and \n",
      "Fallohides. The Harfoots were browner of skin, smaller, and shorter, and \n",
      "they were beardless and bootless; their hands and feet were neat and nimble; \n",
      "and they preferred highlands and hillsides. The Stoors were broader, heavier \n",
      "in build; their feet and hands were larger, and they preferred flat lands \n",
      "and riversides. The Fallohides were fairer of skin and also of hair, and \n",
      "they were taller and slimmer than the others; they were lovers of trees and \n",
      "of woodlands. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Harfoots had much to do with Dwarves in ancient times, and long \n",
      "lived in the foothills of the mountains. They moved westward early, and \n",
      "roamed over Eriador as far as Weathertop while the others were still in the \n",
      "Wilderland. They were the most normal and representative variety of Hobbit, \n",
      "and far the most numerous. They were the most inclined to settle in one \n",
      "place, and longest preserved their ancestral habit of living in tunnels and \n",
      "holes. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Stoors lingered long by the banks of the Great River Anduin, and \n",
      "were less shy of Men. They came west after the Harfoots and followed the \n",
      "course of the Loudwater southwards; and there many of them long dwelt \n",
      "between Tharbad and the borders of Dunland before they moved north again. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Fallohides, the least numerous, were a northerly branch. They were \n",
      "more friendly with Elves than the other Hobbits were, and had more skill in \n",
      "language and song than in handicrafts; and of old they preferred hunting to \n",
      "tilling. They crossed the mountains north of Rivendell and came down the \n",
      "River Hoarwell. In Eriador they soon mingled with the other kinds that had \n",
      "preceded them, but being somewhat bolder and more adventurous, they were \n",
      "often found as leaders or chieftains among clans of Harfoots or Stoors. Even \n",
      "in Bilbo's time the strong Fallohidish strain could still be noted among the \n",
      "greater families, such as the Tooks and the Masters of Buckland. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the westlands of Eriador, between the Misty Mountains and the \n",
      "Mountains of Lune, the Hobbits found both Men and Elves. Indeed, a remnant \n",
      "still dwelt there of the D®nedain, the kings of Men that came over the Sea \n",
      "out of Westernesse; but they were dwindling fast and the lands of their \n",
      "North Kingdom were falling far and wide into waste. There was room and to \n",
      "spare for incomers, and ere long the Hobbits began to settle in ordered \n",
      "communities. Most of their earlier settlements had long disappeared and been \n",
      "forgotten in Bilbo's time; but one of the first to become important still \n",
      "endured, though reduced in size; this was at Bree and in the Chetwood that \n",
      "lay round about, some forty miles east of the Shire. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was in these early days, doubtless, that the Hobbits learned their \n",
      "letters and began to write after the manner of the D®nedain, who had in \n",
      "their turn long before learned the art from the Elves. And in those days \n",
      "also they forgot whatever languages they had used before, and spoke ever \n",
      "after the Common Speech, the Westron as it was named, that was current \n",
      "through all the lands of the kings from Arnor to Gondor, and about all the \n",
      "coasts of the Sea from B elf alas to Lune. Yet they kept a few words of their \n",
      "own, as well as their own names of months and days, and a great store of \n",
      "personal names out of the past. \n",
      "\n",
      "About this time legend among the Hobbits first becomes history with a \n",
      "reckoning of years. For it was in the one thousand six hundred and first \n",
      "year of the Third Age that the Fallohide brothers, Marcho and Blanco, set \n",
      "out from Bree; and having obtained permission from the high king at \n",
      "Fornostl, they crossed the brown river Baranduin with a great following of \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Hobbits. They passed over the Bridge of Stonebows, that had been built in \n",
      "the days of the power of the North Kingdom, and they took ail the land \n",
      "beyond to dwell in, between the river and the Far Downs. All that was \n",
      "demanded of them was that they should keep the Great Bridge in repair, and \n",
      "all other bridges and roads, speed the king's messengers, and acknowledge \n",
      "his lordship. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thus began the Shire-reckoning, for the year of the crossing of the \n",
      "Brandywine (as the Hobbits turned the name) became Year One of the Shire, \n",
      "and all later dates were reckoned from it. 2 At once the western Hobbits fell \n",
      "in love with their new land, and they remained there, and soon passed once \n",
      "more out of the history of Men and of Elves. While there was still a king \n",
      "they were in name his subjects, but they were, in fact, ruled by their own \n",
      "chieftains and meddled not at all with events in the world outside. To the \n",
      "last battle at Fornost with the Witch-lord of Angmar they sent some bowmen \n",
      "to the aid of the king, or so they maintained, though no tales of Men record \n",
      "it. But in that war the North Kingdom ended; and then the Hobbits took the \n",
      "land for their own, and they chose from their own chiefs a Thain to hold the \n",
      "authority of the king that was gone. There for a thousand years they were \n",
      "little troubled by wars, and they prospered and multiplied after the Dark \n",
      "Plague (S.R. 37) until the disaster of the Long Winter and the famine that \n",
      "followed it. Many thousands then perished, but the Days of Dearth (1158-60) \n",
      "were at the time of this tale long past and the Hobbits had again become \n",
      "accustomed to plenty. The land was rich and kindly, and though it had long \n",
      "been deserted when they entered it, it had before been well tilled, and \n",
      "there the king had once had many farms, cornlands, vineyards, and woods. \n",
      "\n",
      "Forty leagues it stretched from the Far Downs to the Brandywine Bridge, \n",
      "and fifty from the northern moors to the marshes in the south. The Hobbits \n",
      "named it the Shire, as the region of the authority of their Thain, and a \n",
      "district of well-ordered business; and there in that pleasant comer of the \n",
      "world they plied their well-ordered business of living, and they heeded less \n",
      "and less the world outside where dark things moved, until they came to think \n",
      "that peace and plenty were the rule in Middle-earth and the right of all \n",
      "sensible folk. They forgot or ignored what little they had ever known of the \n",
      "Guardians, and of the labours of those that made possible the long peace of \n",
      "the Shire. They were, in fact, sheltered, but they had ceased to remember \n",
      "it. \n",
      "\n",
      "At no time had Hobbits of any kind been warlike, and they had never \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "fought among themselves. In olden days they had, of course, been often \n",
      "obliged to fight to maintain themselves in a hard world; but in Bilbo's time \n",
      "that was very ancient history. The last battle, before this story opens, and \n",
      "indeed the only one that had ever been fought within the borders of the \n",
      "Shire, was beyond living memory: the Battle of Greenfields, S.R. 1147, in \n",
      "which Bandobras Took routed an invasion of Ores. Even the weathers had \n",
      "grown \n",
      "\n",
      "milder, and the wolves that had once come ravening out of the North in \n",
      "bitter white winters were now only a grandfather's tale. So, though there \n",
      "was still some store of weapons in the Shire, these were used mostly as \n",
      "trophies, hanging above hearths or on walls, or gathered into the museum at \n",
      "Michel Delving. The Mathom-house it was called; for anything that Hobbits \n",
      "had no immediate use for, but were unwilling to throw away, they called a \n",
      "mathom. Their dwellings were apt to become rather crowded with mathoms, \n",
      "and \n",
      "\n",
      "many of the presents that passed from hand to hand were of that son. \n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless, ease and peace had left this people still curiously tough. \n",
      "\n",
      "They were, if it came to it, difficult to daunt or to kill; and they were, \n",
      "perhaps, so unwearyingly fond of good things not least because they could, \n",
      "when put to it, do without them, and could survive rough handling by grief, \n",
      "foe, or weather in a way that astonished those who did not know them well \n",
      "and looked no further than their bellies and their well-fed faces. Though \n",
      "slow to quarrel, and for sport killing nothing that lived, they were doughty \n",
      "at bay, and at need could still handle arms. They shot well with the bow, \n",
      "for they were keen-eyed and sure at the mark. Not only with bows and arrows. \n",
      "If any Hobbit stooped for a stone, it was well to get quickly under cover, \n",
      "as all trespassing beasts knew very well. \n",
      "\n",
      "All Hobbits had originally lived in holes in the ground, or so they \n",
      "believed, and in such dwellings they still felt most at home; but in the \n",
      "course of time they had been obliged to adopt other forms of abode. Actually \n",
      "in the Shire in Bilbo's days it was, as a rule, only the richest and the \n",
      "poorest Hobbits that maintained the old custom. The poorest went on living \n",
      "in burrows of the most primitive kind, mere holes indeed, with only one \n",
      "window or none; while the well-to-do still constructed more luxurious \n",
      "versions of the simple diggings of old. But suitable sites for these large \n",
      "and ramifying tunnels (or smicils as they called them) were not everywhere to \n",
      "be found; and in the flats and the low-lying districts the Hobbits, as they \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "multiplied, began to build above ground. Indeed, even in the hilly regions \n",
      "and the older villages, such as Hobbiton or Tuckborough, or in the chief \n",
      "township of the Shire, Michel Delving on the White Downs, there were now \n",
      "many houses of wood, brick, or stone. These were specially favoured by \n",
      "millers, smiths, ropers, and Cartwrights, and others of that sort; for even \n",
      "when they had holes to live in. Hobbits had long been accustomed to build \n",
      "sheds and workshops. \n",
      "\n",
      "The habit of building farmhouses and barns was said to have begun among \n",
      "the inhabitants of the Marish down by the Brandywine. The Hobbits of that \n",
      "quarter, the Eastfarthing, were rather large and heavy-legged, and they wore \n",
      "dwarf-boots in muddy weather. But they were well known to be Stoors in a \n",
      "large part of their blood, as indeed was shown by the down that many grew on \n",
      "their chins. No Harfoot or Fallohide had any trace of a beard. Indeed, the \n",
      "folk of the Marish, and of Buckland, east of the River, which they \n",
      "afterwards occupied, came for the most part later into the Shire up from \n",
      "south-away; and they still had many peculiar names and strange words not \n",
      "found elsewhere in the Shire. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is probable that the craft of building, as many other crafts beside, \n",
      "was derived from the D®nedain. But the Hobbits may have learned it direct \n",
      "from the Elves, the teachers of Men in their youth. For the Elves of the \n",
      "High Kindred had not yet forsaken Middle-earth, and they dwelt still at that \n",
      "time at the Grey Havens away to the west, and in other places within reach \n",
      "of the Shire. Three Elf-towers of immemorial age were still to be seen on \n",
      "the Tower Hills beyond the western marches. They shone far off in the \n",
      "moonlight. The tallest was furthest away, standing alone upon a green mound. \n",
      "The Hobbits of the Westfarthing said that one could see the Sea from the lop \n",
      "of that tower; but no Hobbit had ever been known to climb it. Indeed, few \n",
      "Hobbits had ever seen or sailed upon the Sea, and fewer still had ever \n",
      "returned to report it. Most Hobbits regarded even rivers and small boats \n",
      "with deep misgivings, and not many of them could swim. And as the days of \n",
      "the Shire lengthened they spoke less and less with the Elves, and grew \n",
      "afraid of them, and distrustful of those that had dealings with them; and \n",
      "the Sea became a word of fear among them, and a token of death, and they \n",
      "turned their faces away from the hills in the west. \n",
      "\n",
      "The craft of building may have come from Elves or Men, but the Hobbits \n",
      "used it in their own fashion. They did not go in for towers. Their houses \n",
      "were usually long, low, and comfortable. The oldest kind were, indeed, no \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "more than built imitations of smials, thatched with dry grass or straw, or \n",
      "roofed with turves, and having walls somewhat bulged. That stage, however, \n",
      "belonged to the early days of the Shire, and hobbit -building had long since \n",
      "been altered, improved by devices, learned from Dwarves, or discovered by \n",
      "themselves. A preference for round windows, and even round doors, was the \n",
      "chief remaining peculiarity of hobbit-architecture. \n",
      "\n",
      "The houses and the holes of Shire-hobbits were often large, and \n",
      "inhabited by large families. (Bilbo and Frodo Baggins were as bachelors very \n",
      "exceptional, as they were also in many other ways, such as their friendship \n",
      "with the Elves.) Sometimes, as in the case of the Tooks of Great Smials, or \n",
      "the Brandybucks of Brandy Hall, many generations of relatives lived in \n",
      "(comparative) peace together in one ancestral and many -tunnelled mansion. \n",
      "All Hobbits were, in any case, clannish and reckoned up their relationships \n",
      "with great care. They drew long and elaborate family -trees with innumerable \n",
      "branches. In dealing with Hobbits it is important to remember who is related \n",
      "to whom, and in what degree. It would be impossible in this book to set out \n",
      "a family -tree that included even the more important members of the more \n",
      "important families at the time which these tales tell of. The genealogical \n",
      "trees at the end of the Red Book of Westmarch are a small book in \n",
      "themselves, and all but Hobbits would find them exceedingly dull. Hobbits \n",
      "delighted in such things, if they were accurate: they liked to have books \n",
      "filled with things that they already knew, set out fair and square with no \n",
