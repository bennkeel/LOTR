## Process:
1.  Forked this repository from @jblazzy
2.  Scraped the card list and flavor text and card cost of all black-border cards in [Scryfall's card image gallery](https://scryfall.com/sets/ltr?order=set&as=grid). See "FT_Scrape_1.ipynb" file for notebook of Beautiful Soup and Pandas code.
3. Imported this data set into R, cleaned the text, and found all but 15 matches for 194 cards.
4.  Manually confirmed matches for 15 missing cards and for the ~15 that had conflicted matches based on the order of the search.
5.  Graphed the count of items by color and chapter.

6.  Built the layout scene of the 3D model using [this book asset](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/book-28e028e981604aacb25766852aa279ed).
7.  Imported the graph and manually placed the tabs into the books.

9.  Adjusted the composition, textured the books and cards through Blender UV's and Photoshop. Adjusted their material shaders to work well with the lighting.
