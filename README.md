# LOTR
Sentiment analysis and topic modeling on the LOTR corpus. </br>
All significant work is located in LOTR.ipynb, I found Jupyter Notebook to be more effective for this project, as I spent far less time compiling the program, this is usually the case for programs involving work with Natural Language Processing (and extensive use of Lists of Lists).

Corpus Details:
  - The Silmarillion
  - The Hobbit
  - The Fellowship of the Ring
  - The Two Towers
  - The Return of the King
  
**DO NOT** move around the text files. (.txt and '-chapters' files)
