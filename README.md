# "The Flavor Text of Middle Earth" Infographic

## Process:
1.  Forked this repository from @jblazzy
2.  Scraped the card list and flavor text and card cost of all black-border cards in [Scryfall's card image gallery](https://scryfall.com/sets/ltr?order=set&as=grid). See "FT_Scrape_1.ipynb" file for notebook of Beautiful Soup and Pandas code.
3.   Imported this data set into R, cleaned the text, and found all but 15 matches for 194 cards.
