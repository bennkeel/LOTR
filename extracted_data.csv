Wormtongue bared his teeth; and then with a hissing breath he spat before the king’s feet.
The Tooks marched in with Pippin at their head. Merry now had enough sturdy Hobbitry to deal with the ruffians.
"“Farewell, Aragorn! Go to Minas Tirith and save my people!”"
The sword glinted in the westering sun.
"“The Rohirrim have long been the friends of the people of Gondor, though they are not akin to them.”
—Aragorn"
"“Gondor is in great need. Lord Denethor asks for all your strength and all your speed, lest Gondor fall at last.”"
"“How far can you bear me?” asked Gandalf.
“Many leagues,” said Gwaihir, “but not to the ends of the earth. I was sent to bear tidings, not burdens.”"
"“Where now the horse and the rider?
Where is the horn that was blowing?
Where is the helm and the hauberk,
and the bright hair flowing?”
—Lament for the Rohirrim"
"“A chance for Faramir, Captain of Gondor, to show his quality.”"
"Aragorn planted the new tree in the court by the fountain, and swiftly and gladly it began to grow."
"“Cold be hand and heart and bone,
and cold be sleep under stone:
never more to wake on stony bed,
never, till the Sun fails and the Moon is dead.”"
"“One for the Shire!” cried Aragorn. “The Hobbit’s bite is deep! You have a good blade, Frodo son of Drogo!”"
"He passed over Udûn and Gorgoroth and saw all the land in ruin and tumult beneath him, and before him Mount Doom blazing, pouring out its fire."
"“In the days of Isildur, the Ruling Ring passed out of all knowledge.”
—Elrond"
"The ruffian knew too little of Hobbits to understand his peril. Foolishly, he decided to fight."
The Captains of the West came at last to challenge the Black Gate and the might of Mordor.
"Orcs were digging deep trenches in a huge ring, just out of bowshot of the walls, while the Men of Minas Tirith looked on, unable to hinder them."
"As Faramir and Éowyn stood so, their hands met and clasped, though they did not know it."
"“You’ve hurt my master, you brute, and you’ll pay for it.”"
The Hobbits of the Shire were fond of six meals a day—when they could get them.
"“You’re arrested for Gate-breaking, and Tearing up of Rules, and Trespassing, and Bribing Guards with Food.”"
How had it come to be on his finger? He wondered if the Ring itself had not played him a trick.
"“The Dead awaken; for the hour is come for the oathbreakers.”
—Malbeth the Seer"
"“The Enemy must pay dearly for the crossing of the River.”
—Denethor"
"The Tooks came, a hundred strong, from Tuckborough and the Green Hills."
"“The Orcs were greater in number than we counted on. Great Orcs, who also bore the White Hand of Isengard.”
—Éomer"
"It raised the whip, and the thongs whined and cracked. Fire came from its nostrils. But Gandalf stood firm."
“Wear this now in memory of Elfstone and Evenstar with whom your life has been woven!”
"As Bilbo finished his speech, he slipped the ring on his finger, and he was never seen by any Hobbit in Hobbiton again."
"“I looked on Aragorn and thought how great and terrible a Lord he might have become, had he taken the Ring for himself. Not for naught does Mordor fear him.”
—Legolas"
"“There is a great fleet drawing near to the mouths of Anduin, manned by the Corsairs of Umbar in the South. They have long ceased to fear the might of Gondor.”
—Beregond"
"“I will take the Ring to Mordor, though I do not know the way.”
—Frodo"
"“Tell Gandalf that he must seek my aid at once.”
—Saruman"
"“I shall not be dark, but beautiful and terrible as the Morning and the Night! All shall love me and despair!”"
"“This is the hour of the Shire-folk, when they arise from their quiet fields to shake the towers and counsels of the Great. Who of all the Wise could have foreseen it?”"
"“After a hundred years, Hobbits can still surprise you at a pinch.”"
"The Elves of Lórien took Dol Guldur. Galadriel threw down its walls and laid bare its pits, and the forest was cleansed."
“Fear nothing! For tonight you are under the roof of Tom Bombadil.”
"It was an old tradition that beyond the Shire stood the Grey Havens, from which at times elven-ships set sail, never to return."
"“If you will try to run away you must be tied; but we don’t wish to hurt you.”
—Sam"
"The black horses were filled with madness, and leaping forward in terror they bore their riders into the rushing flood."
“I have been too busy with this and that to heed all the crying and shouting. All I hope is that those murdering devils do not come to this House and trouble the sick.”
"“They took me and set me on the pinnacle of Orthanc. I stood alone on an island in the clouds; I had no chance of escape, and my days were bitter and cold.”
—Gandalf"
"After their reunion, the Hobbits spent many days in Ithilien. The stream that flowed from the falls of Henneth Annûn could be heard in the night as it rushed down through its rocky gate."
And so the companies came and were hailed and cheered and passed through the Gate.
"“Look on us now with friendly eyes! Behold the trees of the Naith of Lórien and be glad!”
—Haldir"
"“To the Sea, to the Sea!”"
"“Then come! We have need of speed greater than any wind, outmatching the wings of the Nazgûl.”
—Gandalf"
"“But there are some of us still who go abroad for the gathering of news and the watching of our enemies.”
—Haldir"
“The Corsairs are upon us! Back to the walls! Back to the City before all are overwhelmed!”
“I showed the blade reforged to him. He is not so mighty yet that he is above fear.”
“We have a new errand on this journey: to ambush the Men of Harad.”
“Sauron’s victory is at hand; and there will be rich reward for those who aided it.”
"“I gave you the chance of aiding me willingly.”
—Saruman"
"Frodo’s heart sank. This was too much like trickery, and certainly what he did would seem a treachery to the poor treacherous creature."
"“Fool of a Took! This is a serious journey, not a Hobbit walking-party. Throw yourself in next time, and then you will be no further nuisance. Now be quiet!”"
"Isengard had once been filled with fruitful trees, but no green thing grew there in the latter days of Saruman."
"The branches of the willow began to sway violently. Frodo called for help, but he could hardly hear his own voice: it was blown away from him by the willow-wind and drowned in a clamor of leaves."
"“I tried to take the Ring from Frodo. I am sorry. I have paid.”
—Boromir"
"“When the black breath blows, death’s shadow grows.”
—A rhyme of old days"
“The Ring is mine!”
"“Spies feared on Stairs. Double vigilance. Patrol to head of Stairs.”
—Shagrat’s orders"
"“I think it is a sad story, and it might have happened to others, even to some Hobbits that I have known.”
—Gandalf"
"“What’s that, Strider? It don’t look like a cloud.”
—Sam"
"An army of Easterlings charged forth, while from the hills poured Orcs innumerable."
"“They’ll take it, steal my Precious. Thieves. We hates them.”"
"“It was Pity that stayed Bilbo’s hand. Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment; Gollum has some part to play yet, before the end.”
—Gandalf, to Frodo"
"“Do not weary yourself, or tax too heavily your strength. Let others deal with these irksome guests.”"
"“You should not look in when the candles are lit.”
—Gollum"
"Isildur cut the Ring from Sauron’s hand with the hilt-shard of his father’s sword, and Sauron himself was overthrown."
"Even as the Balrog fell, it swung its whip, and the thongs lashed and curled about Gandalf’s knees, dragging him to the brink of the abyss. “Fly, you fools!” he cried, and was gone."
"Like a storm, they broke upon the line of the Men of Gondor."
"“The enemy has many spies and many ways of hearing.”
—Gandalf"
"“Orcs, thousands of Orcses. Nice Hobbits mustn’t go to those places.”
—Gollum"
Frodo felt a pain like a dart of poisoned ice pierce his left shoulder.
"“And that’s the end of that. A nasty end for Saruman, and I wish I needn’t have seen it; but it’s a good riddance.”
—Sam"
"“By all the signs, there’s a large warrior loose, with an Elf-sword, and an axe as well maybe.” Gorbag spat. Sam smiled grimly at this description of himself."
"As Frodo put on the Ring, Sauron was suddenly aware of the magnitude of his own folly. His wrath blazed in consuming flame, but his fear rose like black smoke."
"As Frodo ran forward, eager, rejoicing to be free, Shelob with hideous speed came behind and stung him in the neck."
"A shuddering howl broke from him, as if he were a captain summoning his pack to the assault."
"In Mordor, all that he knew was forced from him."
"“A great cave-troll, I think. There is no hope of escape that way.”
—Gandalf"
"“What of the dawn? We are the Uruk-hai; we do not stop the fight for night or day, for fair weather or for storm. We come to kill, by sun or moon. What of the dawn?”"
"“An Orc shot Balin from behind a stone. We slew the Orc, but many more came.”
—Book of Mazarbul"
“It might have been mine. It should be mine. Give it to me!”
"“But for Gollum, I could not have destroyed the Ring. So let us forgive him! For the Quest is achieved, and now all is over.”
—Frodo"
"“The Nazgûl closed round at night, and I was besieged. Such light and flame cannot have been seen on Weathertop since the war-beacons of old.”
—Gandalf"
"“Need brooks no delay, yet late is better than never.”"
But northward the white crest of Éomer led the great front of the Rohirrim which he had again gathered and marshaled.
"“We make good armor and keen swords, but we cannot again make mail or blade to match those that our fathers made before the dragon came.”
—Glóin"
"Down from the hills leaped Erkenbrand, lord of Westfold, and the hosts of Isengard roared in fear."
"“Open, in the name of Mordor!”"
"Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatulûk agh burzum-ishi krimpatul."
The barricade was scattered as if by a thunderbolt.
“Twenty-one!” cried Gimli. He hewed a two- handed stroke and laid the last Orc before his feet. “Now my count passes Master Legolas.”
"“Two!” said Gimli, patting his axe."
"“Let us hope that fire now lies between us and pursuit. Come! There is no time to lose.”
—Gandalf"
"“In the South the Haradrim are moving, and fear has fallen on all our coastlands.”
—Hirgon, errand-rider of Gondor"
"“‘For a couple o’ pins,‘ says Troll, and grins, 'I’ll eat thee too and gnaw thy shins.’”
—Sam"
"There was a rush of hoarse laughter, like the fall of sliding stones into a pit; amid the clamor a deep voice was raised in command."
"Trolls were abroad, no longer dull-witted, but cunning and armed with dreadful weapons."
"“It is a joy to us to see you return into your own.”
—Éomer"
"With a cry and a great noise they charged. Down from the gates they roared, over the causeway they swept, and they drove through the hosts of Isengard as a wind among grass."
"“Keep close to the fire, with your faces outward! Get some of the longer sticks ready in your hands!”
—Strider"
"“The Orcs are in the Deep! Helm! Helm! Forth Helmingas!”
—Gamling the Old"
Over the low hills the horns were sounding. Hastening down the long slopes were a thousand men on foot; their swords were in their hands.
"“Dire deeds awake, dark is it eastward. Let horse be bridled, horn be sounded!”
—Théoden"
"There was a horn-blast and a rush of feet, and Orcs one after another leaped into the chamber."
“No living man am I!”
"“One ill turn deserves another.”
—Saruman"
"Drums rolled, fires leaped, and great engines drawn by beasts crawled across the field."
"“Dwarves’ tongues run on when speaking of their handiwork, they say.”
—Glóin"
"“Hey dol! merry dol! ring a dong dillo!
Ring a dong! hop along! fal lal the willow!
Tom Bom, jolly Tom, Tom Bombadillo!”"
"“Your land must be a realm of peace and content, and there must gardeners be in high honor.”
—Faramir"
"His eyes were keen as lances in starlight, and yet profound, the wells of deep memory."
"“It is said, ‘Go not to the Elves for counsel, for they will say both no and yes.’”
—Frodo"
"There were toys the Hobbit-children had never seen before, all beautiful, and some obviously magical."
“Aragorn has need of his kindred. Let the Dúnedain go to him in Rohan!”
"“A Elbereth Gilthoniel, silivren penna míriel o menel aglar elenath!”"
"“Few can foresee whither their road will lead them, till they come to its end.”
—Legolas"
"“They stand watching endlessly over the trees. It is difficult to see them moving, but they can move very quickly if they are angry.”
—Merry"
“Welcome to the Treegarth of Orthanc!”
"“I came and called the trees by their long names, but they did not hear or answer—they lay dead.”
—Quickbeam"
"“I am an Ent. Fangorn is my name according to some, Treebeard others make it.”"
"“I shall lead you well, and the paths are smooth and straight.”"
"“None have ever made to me a request so bold and yet so courteous.”
—Galadriel"
"On the Elf-lord’s brow sat wisdom, and in his hand was strength."
"“To Isengard with doom we come!
With doom we come, with doom we come!”"
"“That was the custom of the Elves of Lórien, to dwell in the trees. Therefore they were called Galadhrim, the Tree-people.”
—Legolas"
"“For you in all the lands of the West there will ever be a welcome, dearest friend.”
—Aragorn"
"“My dear old Hobbit, you don’t allow for the inquisitiveness of friends. I have known about the existence of the Ring for years.”"
"Far and wide Shelob’s lesser broods spread from glen to glen, to Dol Guldur and the fastnesses of Mirkwood."
"“But still the sunken stars appear
In dark and windless Mirrormere;
There lies his crown in water deep,
Till Durin wakes again from sleep.”
—Gimli’s song"
"“They won’t harm you—not unless I tell ‘em to. Here, Grip! Fang! Heel!”
—Farmer Maggot"
“Sam! Get breakfast ready for half-past nine!”
"Pippin stabbed upwards, and the written blade of Westernesse pierced through the hide and went deep into the vitals of the troll."
"“It is only a nickname, of course. They have called me that ever since I said yes to an elder Ent before he had finished his question.”"
"In the Party Field, a beautiful young sapling leaped up: it was indeed a mallorn, and it was the wonder of the neighborhood."
"“I wish there were more of your kin among us, Gimli. But even more would I give for a hundred good archers of Mirkwood. We shall need them.”
—Legolas"
"“Stew the rabbits?” squealed Gollum in dismay. “Spoil beautiful meat Sméagol saved saved for you, poor hungry Sméagol! What for?”"
"“Road is forgotten, but not by Wild Folk. Over hill and behind hill it lies still under grass and tree. Wild Folk will show you that road.”"
"She was called Undómiel, for she was the Evenstar of her people."
“I don’t know half of you half as well as I should like; and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve.”
"“I hope you’ll be comfortable. You’ll be wanting supper, I don’t doubt. As soon as may be. This way now!”"
“Much must be risked in war.”
"“Speak, friend, and enter.”"
“Am I not of the House of Eorl? I have waited on faltering feet long enough.”
"The City was made more fair than it had ever been, even in the days of its first glory."
"There was a ringing clash and a stab of white fire, and the Balrog fell back."
"“Forty-two, Master Legolas!”
—Gimli"
"“Few have ever come hither through greater peril or on an errand more urgent.”
—Elrond"
"“I pass the test. I will diminish, and go into the West, and remain Galadriel.”"
"There was a crack, and the staff split asunder in Saruman’s hand, and the head of it fell down at Gandalf’s feet."
"There came Gwaihir the Windlord, greatest of all the Eagles of the North, mightiest of the descendants of old Thorondor."
“Two?” said Legolas. “I make my tale twenty at the least.”
"“Whatever is wrong in the Shire, Lotho will be at the bottom of it: you can be sure of that.”
—Pippin"
"“We are the servants of Saruman the Wise, the White Hand: the Hand that gives us Man’s-flesh to eat.”"
"Then suddenly Merry felt it at last, beyond doubt: a change. Wind was in his face!"
"“Here do I swear fealty to Gondor, until my lord release me, or death take me.”"
"“The Lord Aragorn I hold to be my liege lord, whether he claim it or no. His wish is to me a command.”"
Frodo was able to see beneath their black wrappings. In their white faces burned keen and merciless eyes.

They could eat of it and find new strength even as they ran.

Frodo’s heart flamed within him. He drew his sword and advanced.

"Now the cries of clear strong voices came ringing over the fields. They rode in: a long line of mail-clad Men, swift, shining, fell and fair to look upon. Suddenly they swept up with a noise like thunder, and the foremost horseman swerved."
“No living man may hinder me!”
"The fighting waxed furious on the fields of the Pelennor; and the din of arms rose upon high, with the crying of Men and the neighing of horses. But the hosts of Mordor were enheartened, and filled with a new fury they came yelling to the onset."

“Much must be risked in war.”
